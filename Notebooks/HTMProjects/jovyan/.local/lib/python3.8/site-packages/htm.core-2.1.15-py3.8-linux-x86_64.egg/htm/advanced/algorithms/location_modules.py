    A model of a grid cell module. The module has one or more Gaussian activity
    bumps that move as the population receives motor input. When two bumps are
    near each other, the intermediate cells have higher firing rates than they
    would with a single bump. The cells with firing rates above a certain
    threshold are considered "active".

    We don't model the neural dynamics of path integration. When the network
    receives a motor command, it shifts its bumps. We do this by tracking each
    bump as floating point coordinates, and we shift the bumps with movement. This
    model isn't attempting to explain how path integration works. It's attempting
    to show how a population of cells that can path integrate are useful in a
    larger network.

    The cells are distributed uniformly through the rhombus, packed in the optimal
    hexagonal arrangement. During learning, the cell nearest to the current phase
    is associated with the sensed feature.

    This class doesn't choose working parameters for you. You need to give it a
    coherent mix of cellsPerAxis, activeFiringRate, and bumpSigma that:
     1. Ensure at least one cell fires at each location
     2. Use a large enough set of active cells that inference accounts for
            uncertainty in the learned locations.

    A model of a location module. It's similar to a grid cell module, but it uses
    squares rather than triangles.

    The cells are arranged into a m*n rectangle which is tiled onto 2D space.
    Each cell represents a small rectangle in each tile.

    We assume that path integration works *somehow*. This model receives a "delta
    location" vector, and it shifts the active cells accordingly. The model stores
    intermediate coordinates of active cells. Whenever sensory cues activate a
    cell, the model adds this cell to the list of coordinates being shifted.
    Whenever sensory cues cause a cell to become inactive, that cell is removed
    from the list of coordinates.

    (This model doesn't attempt to propose how "path integration" works. It
    attempts to show how locations are anchored to sensory cues.)

    When orientation is set to 0 degrees, the displacement is a [di, dj],
    moving di cells "down" and dj cells "right".

    When orientation is set to 90 degrees, the displacement is essentially a
    [dx, dy], applied in typical x,y coordinates with the origin on the bottom
    left.

    Usage:
    - When the sensor moves, call movementCompute.
    - When the sensor senses something, call sensoryCompute.

    The "anchor input" is typically a feature-location pair SDR.

    To specify how points are tracked, pass anchoringMethod = "corners",
    "narrowing" or "discrete".    "discrete" will cause the network to operate in a
    fully discrete space, where uncertainty is impossible as long as movements are
    integers.    "narrowing" is designed to narrow down uncertainty of initial
    locations of sensory stimuli.    "corners" is designed for noise-tolerance, and
    will activate all cells that are possible outcomes of path integration.
