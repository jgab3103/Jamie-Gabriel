    "There are lots of machine learning, the purpose of these notebooks is to explroe HTM, a different approach, and provide both workign the code and the theory. It can seem a little difficult at times. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bigger purpose take some of the mathematics and apply it to these algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting things set up: \n",
    "\n",
    "The very First thing we want to do with HTM is get set up. So we can explore the theory in the context of a an extisting cod ebase and run our code in different ways. To do this we will need. Teh community version is htm.core which is a rewrite of the original code. THe code is in C++ and also has a python version. IN this notebook we will get to the hello world stage, so we know the code and then go back to building up the our knowlege but also the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "First: a bit of context around the code: htm.core is a community version of the code, an implementation. There are a number of implementations, this is really stable and \n",
    "\n",
    "Now while you can run htm.core directly through Python, we are going to install the the C++ version for now. Many people are more confortable with Python, and this might appear challenging at first an spin it up with a jupyter notebook. The reasons for working directly with the C++ code base are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up is much simpler. Getting the python up and running is get's a little runs into issues like OS specific. It get's messy with Anaconda. The C++ build is far simpler and the commands won't. I will take you through a simple set up below and point you to some resources. You run into machine specific versions and it gets a bit messy\n",
    "- The C++ code in htm.core is logically put together and easy read, and you will be referring to it alot. Going through it's a great way to get acquainted\n",
    "- Along the way we can look at g++ compiler, how to compile from source, and then also use this opportunity to relationship between python bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "So before doing any else, let's get to the point where we can run some code. To do this, we are going to the simplest approach possible: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will use an Ubuntu image from Docker to create a linux container (it doesnt matter). \n",
    "2. Then wee will download the code and put it into a folder that our container can see \n",
    "3. We will build and install the code into the container using some basic cmake and make commands\n",
    "4. This will create the executables files we need\n",
    "5. We will run the hello and mnist examples to check it works, and \n",
    "6. Finally, we will make a tiny change in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have nothing set up, this will take a bout 5-10 minutes\n",
    " \n",
    " We will get this out of the way now, and then we will spend a good deal of time focusing on theory itself\n",
