    "Episode 0 provides to HTM. Important things to note in tis video: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The neocortex is the sheet that wraps around the top of the brain. We find that neocortex accounts for around 75% of the brain's mass and has evolved in mammals, particularly humans. In HTM world, it is often described as around 2.5mm thick, scrunched up inside the human skull, similar to a dinner napkin.  You can see an image of it below that sits. While a number of functions that human's undertake (such as eatings/sleeping/sex etc.) emanate from other parts of the brain, the neocortex holds memories, the notion of identity, intelligence, and is sometimes referred to as the \"seat of intelligence\". \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you examine the neocortex under a microscope, it turns out that the cellular structure in different regions is almost identical. This suggests that however the neocortex works, it has a similar approach to processing information of different modalities, such as visual / auditory  etc. When the neocortex solves any kind problem, the same cortical structure is always in ply, or the same algorithmic structureYou can visualise it as per below: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The neocortex in an average human adult contains 20-30 billion neurons, and  neuron is a type cell. \n",
    "* You can think of a neuron as having two electrical states at any 1 time. It is either at around -70 millivolts and considered in an 'off' state, or it is 'firing' about 100 millivolts. At any one time, all neurons in the neocortext state is what can be regarded as on or off. \n",
    "* At any point, it is the case that a remarkably small percentate of bits are on (around 2%)\n",
    "* The motivation still draws on  neural networks over 50 years ago, sicne then things advanced, better underst of biology, but still hasn't moved forward too much - ANNs (neural networks) stil not plausible \n",
    "\n",
    "Neocotex has regions, of neocortex. Nerve fibers exist through white matter allowing information to come from lower levels through higher levels, sending output upwards. As informaiton moves through these regious, the ideas that the information represetns become more abstract and more permnanent. For exaple\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lowest level: edges and borders\n",
    "- Higher Level: shape recognition\n",
    "- Next highest Level: object recognition\n",
    "- Next highest level: ideas and memories\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the structure of the neocortex, and the common process, it allows not to be concerned with the myriad wasy ways information comes into the neocortex and focus on how information is processed. Futhermore, because of the architecture, we can can focus on region as they are all the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some citircal things to deal with early on with understanding neocortex - firstly, the idea of regions can be potentially confusing, and we will tie back this. To note various regious etc that are avalialble\n",
    "\n",
    "We are left with a structure that is well suited to Linear Algebra over a bifield: large netorks that is connected where majority of nodes of are are 0 and some are 1. This structure leads us to the basic idea of <b>Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR)</b>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In th same way that Linear Algebra can be used to reduce networks down to the interplay between nodes and edges, this SDR array structure is a model of SDR. This basic SDR structure facilitiates the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Inputs into the neocortex from a copy of the motor commands coming out of the old brain <br/> When informaiton sent being sent to control muscles, coming in, copy goes into neocortex, so it can undertand how it interacting\n",
    "2. Sensory input coming form the outside world<br/> This includes senssory inputs from oming from all the, touch, smell etc. all copied and sent to neocortex - represetnation of what is happening in the world - provide sensory motor model, what is happening, and how it is interacting....eg optic nerve, sending new different pictures, provides continuity, data comes from our brains to provide this also\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that for any HTM system to exist, it needs the equivalent of sensory encoder. We need to be careful that by this we mean some kind of sensory endoing but not that it has to be what human would expect, such as sight, sound, taste etc. Any HTM system requires some kind of sensory imput which is converted into the form of an SDR that can then be in converts them into SDR that system can understand. But that does not mean we can't have encoders that have no biological counterpart, such as a geocoding encoder (i.e. a sense that tracks location)\n",
    "\n",
    "To process SDRs HTM uses an algorithm called Temporal Memory. This Algorithm learns uses SDRs to learn patterns that are changing over time driven by SDR input. It perates on motor commands and sens imput. Temporal Memory will become more critical as we go on:  biggest different to standard ML. HTM starts with assumption that everything based on memory and recall of sequences of patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The contrasts to other types of machine learning does not end there: HTM systems learn continuously. There is no training set, no batch processing, the model changes as data changes. This allows the HTM build predictive model of the world, and adapt to how well it is going (JG:: idea of correction from muliple agents)\n",

    "Important to note that Episode 1 is not so much focused on HTM, rather it is a primer for working with bit array's. If you confortable working with programming languages where this comes up a bit, the advice is that this video could be skipped. Still, I found it quite handy. \n",

    "Important things to note in this video: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A bit here refers to a \"binary digit\" which can be thought of as the smallest unit of measurement used to quantify computer data. A bit can encode either a binary value 0 or 1. Be a little careful with this defintion, as the idea of a bit can be somewhat nuanced in the way it represented in Information Theory (see for discussion). For us, we are simply talking about a variable which can take on only 2 values, 0 or 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can think of the 0 or 1 as two states that bit can be in. People tend use different types of nomenclature to capture this idea: 1 or 0, on or off, true of false, etc. Whatever language is used, the value of bit tells about its state in regard to the possible values it can take on. \n",
    "\n",
    "* An ordered list of bits, which you might visualise as something like <b>00110011</b> is an example of <b>bit array</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bit arrays are well suited to encode information. Consider that, if I have 8 bit array in which each bit could be the state of 0 or 1, I can create 256 unique 8 bit arrays (say, 00000000, 00000001, 00000011, etc). The math behind this is straight forward $2^8 = 256$, which is short hand for saying that there are 256 ways to arrange 8 values that each can have a 0 or 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Its important to note that a bit array has no semantic value as such, however they are a very effective way to encode information. For example, i However we could arbitrarily take, say, 256 symbols, and assign them each a bit array to differentiate meaning between them. This is actually ascii formatting works. The symbol \"m\" is mapped into your computer to the as the specific bit array 01101101. This introduces the idea that \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are some basic operations that can take place with bit arrays: AND, OR and XOR. Each of these can be thought of a function that takes two bits and returns 1 bit. There is also a NOT operation that takes 1 bit as an input and returns 1 bit\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/><b>AND</b>: If both values are 1, this will return 1. \n",
    "<br/><b>OR</b>: The OR function takes two bits. If either of these is 1, the OR function will return 1\n",

Complex feedback mechanism in play about how the neocortex copes with recieving input audiotry and motor input and is involved in planning music you are about to play, and feeds them down to lower regions of the cortex.

    "* The number of active bits in a given bit array is of critical importance in HTM. For example, 00111111 has more active bits (or a greater population) that 00000111. This difference in bit arrays is often qualitavely described in terms of sparsity and density to respectively describe bit arrays with predominantly zeros or  predominantly ones. There is quanatitative metric associated with this which can be used as a measure of sparsity, or percentage of active bits in an array: \n",
    "<br/>\n",

    "For example, in a bit array of size 256, where 6 bits are active (where $w=6$ and $n=256$), this sparsity metric is just over $2%$ and given its a very percentage, we would say sparse bit array.  \n",

To me we are really starting to touch on core concerns in Informaiton theory, how many can we change message, because how much capacity is required can think of this in different ways, to me the idea is closest to the idea of Information Theory, touching on informaitin theory, that we can flip bits. It also introduces us to the idea of a threshold, which we will denote $\\theta$\n",
