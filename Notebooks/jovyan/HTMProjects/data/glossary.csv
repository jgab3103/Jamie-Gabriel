Tags,Term,ParamName,Description
spatial pooler,Column,column,"An HTM region is organized in columns of cells. The SP operates at the column-level, where a column of a cells function as a single computational unit."
spatial pooler,Inhibition,,The mechanism for maintaining sparse activations of neurons. In the SP this manifests as columns inhibiting nearby columns from becoming active.
spatial pooler,Inhibition radius,,"The size of a column's local neighborhood, within which columns may inhibit each other from becoming active."
spatial pooler,Active duty cycle,activeDutyCycle,A moving average denoting the frequency of column activation.
spatial pooler,Overlap duty cycle,overlapDutyCycle,A moving average denoting the frequency of the column's overlap value being at least equal to the proximal segment activation threshold.
spatial pooler,Receptive field,receptiveReceptiveField,The input space that a column can potentially connect to
spatial pooler,Permance value,permancePermanceValue,"indicates the amount of growth between a mini-column in the Spatial Pooling algorithm and one of the cells in its receptive field. Acceptable values are [0,1]."
spatial pooler,Permance threshold,permancePermanceThreshold,"If a synapse's permanence is above this value, it is considered fully connected."
spatial pooler; neuroscience,Synapse,,"A junction between cells. In the Spatial Pooling algorithm, synapses on a column's dendritic segment connect to bits in the input space. A synapse can be in the following states: Connected: permanence is above the threshold, Potential: permanence is below the threshold, Unconnected: does not have the ability to connect."
