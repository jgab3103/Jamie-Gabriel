An implementation of thalamic control and routing as proposed in the Cosyne

class Thalamus(object):
    """

    A simple discrete time thalamus.    This thalamus has a 2D TRN layer and a 2D
    relay cell layer. L6 cells project to the dendrites of TRN cells - these
    connections are learned. TRN cells project to the dendrites of relay cells in
    a fixed fan-out pattern. A 2D feed forward input source projects to the relay
    cells in a fixed fan-out pattern.

    The output of the thalamus is the activity of each relay cell. This activity
    can be in one of three states: inactive, active (tonic), and active (burst).

    TRN cells control whether the relay cells will burst. If any dendrite on a TRN
    cell recognizes the current L6 pattern, it de-inactivates the T-type CA2+
    channels on the dendrites of any relay cell it projects to. These relay cells
    are then in "burst-ready mode".

    Feed forward activity is in the form of a binary vector corresponding to
    active/spiking axons (e.g. from ganglion cells). Any relay cells that receive
    input from an axon will either output tonic or burst activity depending on the
    state of the T-type CA2+ channels on their dendrites. Relay cells that don't
    receive input will remain inactive, regardless of their dendritic state.

    Usage:

        1. Train the TRN cells on a bunch of L6 patterns: learnL6Pattern()

        2. De-inactivate relay cells by sending in an L6 pattern: deInactivateCells()

        3. Compute feed forward activity for an input: computeFeedForwardActivity()

        4. reset()

        5. Goto 2
