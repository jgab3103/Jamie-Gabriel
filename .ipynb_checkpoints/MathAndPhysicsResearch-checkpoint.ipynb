    "When you are starting out in mathematics, the first thing that is important to understand is various topics in pre-calculus: things like algebra, trigonometry, conics, logarithms, exponentials and so on. This is the kind of thing that you would find standard high school curriculum. I am writing this book in Australia and ther are a number of different levels of year 12 mathematics and the Mathematics Advanced Curriculum is fine for all of these topics. In the curriculum in NSW, Australia, there are harder levels of Math, called Extension 1 and Extension 2. But you don't need that, the Mathematics Advanced is quite good and will also Calculus and Integration to give you a taste of what is to come. It is pretty comparable to math in most countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "I actually came back to mathematics quite some time after high school, and the best text book I found is Stitz and Zeager's text, <i>PreCalculus</i>. It will give you a good grounding in lots of topics, and all the basics that tend to come up later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Calculus</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are working through topics Precalculus, you may choose to work with pen and paper and work things out by hand. Chances are, if you are in a high school program this will be you experience. However, once you have finished this, I would suggest doing things computationally almost exclusively. This is after all a text that is focused on the computational mathematics. A good time to make this transition is when you are starting to do things beyond standard high school mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the code that I refer to in this book is in Python. I have lots of tools over the years, such as Mathematica and RStudio to Matlab, but I find that Python, its easy to set up, free. While Python has its own specialised set of libraries, However, I will only use standard python libraries (predominantly SymPy and NumPy) for everything that we are doing to do. You will find lots of different options, I tend to use Python because its quite easy to solve any kind of computational problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you decide what computational software to use, you should use it to get your Calculus. There are lots of good Calculus resources out there. A nice and free one that I have found is <i>Paul's Calculus Notes</i> which you can work through to a advanced level of calculus. You will find that using a computer to take derivatives and integrals will radically speed up your workflow, and you should treat this as an opportunity to also get comfortable sketching\n",
    "diagrams, working in a flow with a computer. You should cover Calculus I, II and III and the differential equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have some guides on my websites for working through questions. When you work though these, do not be concerned with the proofs. Use the formulas, use it as an opportunity to solve problems and understand the kinds of problems that Calculus sets out to solve. TWe will be taking a Lagrangian approach towards Calculus, using a Lagrangian approach. But the advantage is to understand what Calculus can do as a technology.\n",

If you work through them examples, not even so much the exercises at the end of each chapture. Again, these are freely available. Work through the questions.

Chances are, you may have covered this content in a standard science degree. But at the same time, its reasonable to ask. If you have a sense of  I am not going to assume that. Anything beyond that will be introduced very carefully and slowly.  And there is a fair part of reframing up rejecting.
