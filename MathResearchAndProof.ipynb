    "It is perhaps unusual that mathematics, with its seemingly complex computation feels, but is really just about language. However what mathematics is really about is semantic consistence and memory. This is meant very much in a computer science way. one of the challenges is how to write effective proofs. It is critical mathematics is computable, and specification, is is possible articulate language in such as way. \n",

    "What this highlight however is that in mathematics, that perhaps unexpectedly, language is often used in quite a general way. Yte the purpose of mathematics is above all, precision in language. Exactitude, to speak in a way that can be clearly interpreted. This is related to something else, universal specification, in which the symbols of the language can be . \n",
