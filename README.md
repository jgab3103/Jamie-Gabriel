# Jamie Gabriel


I set up this repo to hold links to my study notes, projects and templates, mostly in the area of math and computer science.


Setup:

For Windows, there are currently issues running htm code. Use the Sage Docker Compose file and <code>docker-compose up</code>

For Mac, use docker run -p 8888:8888 --user root -v /Users/jamiegabriel/Desktop/Jamie-Gabriel/Notebooks:/home jupyter/datascience-notebook as a base image and add in htm.core compilation

I will fix this at some point 

then jump in and update

git clone https://github.com/htm-community/htm



apt-get install cmake

python setup.py install --user --force

then set up docs

then set up C++
