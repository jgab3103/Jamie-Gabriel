    "Note that transposition affects mostly Wind and Brass family instruments. There is a complicated history around why we have transposing instruments. There are lots of arguments about this kind of thing, but it really just relates to convenience to allow players to move between instruments and play parts at sight more easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two issues to contend with when it comes to transposing instruments: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you encounter a note of a transposing instrument written on a score, you will need to transpose this note in order to find out the concert pitch is being played. For example, a C4-Note played on a Bb Clarinet will sound a major second lower, a Bb3-Note; a C5-Note played on an Alto Flute (a transposing instrument in the key of G) will result in a concert note that is a perfect fourth lower, a G4-Note. To read scores effectively, you need to be able to quickly transpose notes to understand which concert pitch they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. As a consequence of this different key signatures will appear in a scores. Suppose that you want the Clarinet player to play the notes G-F-E in a score that has a key of C Major played. To do this, you need to write all notes a major second higher, A-G-F#. To avoid the need to put in accidentals, you can change the key signature to D Major. The clarinet player will read this as written and provide the passage sounding in C Major\n",
    "\n",
    "This list below should be memorised. You should know the instrument name, the concert note that is sounded when a C-Note is played, the transposition that you need to make when reading a score. Ideally, you should also be aware that these instruments have notes in different registers and there can be challenges moving between registers and this should be taken into account when writting for these instruments. More details of this coming in a later notebook.  develop recognition of each instruments transposed registers and concert ranges"
