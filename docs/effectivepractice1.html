    <h3>The Art of Effective Practice (Part 1)</h3>

    <a class="back-link" href="./articles.html">← Back</a>

    <p>
        When I first became interested in music, it was like being presented with enormous sonic structures full of moving parts that I was desperate to understand. And it didn’t really matter if I was listening to Mahler, Stravinsky, Coltrane, or Bill Evans. My mind was just blown. I wanted to know everything about everything. And the thought of learning about it seemed overwhelming.
    </p>

    <p>
        Perhaps the first question I had about music (from a somewhat naive viewpoint) was: how does it actually work? At the same time it was bound up with all kinds of other questions: Why does a composer or improviser choose particular notes? How do all these sounds blend together? Why is any piece conceived the way it is? What underlies these processes?
    </p>

    <p>
        In retrospect, I feel like there were really two questions I was grappling with. The first asked how music worked. The second asked what I should practice and learn to develop this understanding. After many years of studying different aspects of music, the purpose of this article is to outline some thoughts on what has helped most.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have broken this article into three parts. Here are the first three important takeaways about effective music practice:
    </p>

    <h4>Practice tip 1:</h4>
    <i>Make a list of things you would like to learn about music. Don’t panic about the time it takes. Accept that the list will change as you change. This is a lifelong journey and that is ok.</i>

    <p>
        Reflect on the different kinds of skills you might want to develop. Do you want virtuosic mastery on an instrument, or to play a broad repertoire? Do you want solitary study or ensemble experience? Or are you interested in composing, conducting, or writing music for media? Your directions may evolve over time, and that is fine.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I first studied music formally, piano lessons were a great starting point. This led naturally to theory, four-part harmony, counterpoint, harmonic analysis, and writing exercises. Studying scores, orchestration, and transposing instruments was initially difficult, but it deepened my understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Eventually, jazz changed my perspective, influencing instrument choice and approaches to harmony, rhythm, and melody. Each element of my study contributed valuable insights—Chopin informed voice leading, Lee Konitz inspired melody, Charlie Parker and Gary Peacock shaped my understanding of rhythm.
    </p>

    <h4>Practice tip 2:</h4>
    <i>Carry out your study in a way that exposes you to different music. Be bold and follow all the threads. Actively listen and make this part of your practice.</i>

    <p>
        Exposure to varied repertoire is essential. Studying classical piano repertoire (Bach, Mozart, Brahms, Scarlatti, Bartok) developed tonal and formal understanding. Exploring French orchestral music, Shostakovich, and jazz expanded harmonic and rhythmic horizons. Listening actively—studying scores, counting bars, comparing interpretations—is crucial.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even albums with complex rhythms, like Chris Potter’s <em>Circuits</em>, require focused listening to grasp time signatures and syncopation. Active participation enhances understanding and musical insight, making listening a vital part of practice.
    </p>

    <h4>Practice tip 3:</h4>
    <i>Seek out great teachers, and know you have the capacity to be your own teacher.</i>

    <p>
        Understanding music evolves with experience. Consciousness develops a sense of which notes are appropriate, often beyond verbal explanation. Learning becomes about a way of being. Pay attention to yourself as a teacher acquiring knowledge, but also seek guidance from exceptional teachers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the years, amazing teachers like Carl Orr and Dave Smith provided deep insights into jazz guitar, improvisation, harmony, and precision. Their guidance shaped my musical understanding, demonstrating the value of mentorship alongside self-directed learning.

        Ok, that is enough for this post! I will leave it to the <a href="./effectivepractice2.html">next article</a>.
