I set up this page to hold links to various research study notes I have being writing up. Its mostly in math and computer science. I am trying to slowly work through my messy Github repos, get things clean things up and post them here to have an easy point of reference.

Over the last couple of years I have also been spending time getting up to speed on working through NJ Wildberger. There are so many proofs, and I am trying  and wanted a place to easily post proofs I am sketching out.

<div>Most of these notes have been created in either:
-  A Sage JupyterLab environment running on Docker. For full details of the Docker Image see <a href = "https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/">https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/</a>. This Docker Image is a really nice setup to work with all things Python</div>
- In RStudio, just standard local machine install, and markdowns

No doubt there are errors to be found here. Feel free to hit me up on Github for any corrections
