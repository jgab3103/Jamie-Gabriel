This page contains links to Research notes, around math and computer science topics. I try to post notes almost in finished draft, and the repo holds of alot of more rough stuff. At the moment, I am mostly working through NJ Wildberger notes on, sketches of proofs,

Please feel free to send me a pull request if you notice any errors, or suggest a better way to code things
