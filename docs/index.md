I set up this page to hold links to the various research study notes I have being writing up, mostly in math and computer science. The plan is to slowly work through my messy Github repos, clean things up and post them here to have an easy point of reference.


Most of these notes have been created either by:

-  Using a Sage JupyterLab environment running on Docker.
 For full details of the Docker Image see <a href = "https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/">https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/</a>. This is a really nice setup to work with all things Python</div>
- Using RStudio, studio server Docker version, but nothing non-standard.

I have posted html version of these notes, but if you want the original notebook files, just head on over to the Github. No doubt there are errors to be found here. So feel free to hit me up on Github for any corrections
