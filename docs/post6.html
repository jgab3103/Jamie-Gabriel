<h4>Heidegger on Technology</h4>

<hr/>

<h6>1. Introduction</h6>

<div>

Martin Heidegger wrote his essay, <i>The Question Concerning Technology</i> in 1954. Less than a decade after WWII, when the ramifications of widespread violence still to make thier the the nuanced layers the popular and scientific imagination. Far from the sheer destruction wrought being a signal to the populace at large around the the dangers of technology, the sustained bout of violence of the world war led to a rapid increase in the applications technology, from industry, automation and information, driven by practical problems of milatry machine. There is a complicated pyschology in play here no doubt: that inate human need to open pandoras box regardless of consequence relates to the rise of violence. Whatever technology might be, its manifestations alluring promise over the control of nature, a control over the time, and ultaimately immortality make it too seducing. 
</div><br/>

<div>

So it is against this backdrop that Heidegger writes his essay, seeking to capture something far deeper than just those surface instances of technology. The essence of technology is not something to be characterised by the presence of factories, or automobiles, or distorted industrial landscapes. Heidegger intends to dig deeper, to understand what it is that lies under the surface, what technology is when looking beyond its instances. He links it to his conception of Being (what Heidegger calls <i>Dasien</i>) that positions technology as a mechanism that Dasien can access, to facilitate a richer interaction with this world. It's hard to say where Heidegger's final position really is in this essay: not quiteoptimism, more a genuine interest in what might happen next as modern technology grows. Heidegger is not sure if technology will be the end of the human race, or come to be regarded as its turbulent adolescence.  

</div><br/>

<div>
A few disclaimers before getting into it. Firstly, Heidegger often comes across to me to fairly self contained when he writes. The invented words (thing 'destinging') belie an underlying and refreshing logic. There is in this tech . Secondly, there is (implictly at least) refeence to the Dasein. This does require some context from his other writings, but I will cover this and in any case, take a particular interpretation. Finally, it is tempting to paint Heidegger as some kind of luddite, a countryside recluse, and lamenting the decline of the modern world from a Wagerian past. This narrative certainly lends credence to interpretations of his biography is complicated, his relationship to Nazism (though I note thier relationship to him certainly seemed soured over time). While it's important to acknolwedge historical and moral context, waht fascinates me about this essay is that it cuts across the context of Heidegger's histroy and the time in which he lived. There is something timeless about it, that technology regardless of what it creates has an mysterious essence that is problematic for Dasien. I will use Self and Dasien interchangebly for the first part of the this essay.

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>What is dangerous is not technology. Technology is not demonic; but its essense is mysterious. The essence of technooogy, as destining of revealing, is the danger.</i>(p.2)
<br/>

</div><br/>



<h6>2. From contrivance to causality to revealing</h6>

<div>
Reading Heidegger is often akin to pulling on a sumptious Platonic golden thread. His language is so carefully constructed, words are invented when needed in a way that has the utmost respect for clarity. With an unwavering committment to first principles, he starts the discussion in the most general way possible. The question of what is technology becomes the general question of what, really is anything:
</div><br/>

<div>
<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Accoring to ancient doctrine, the essense of a thing is considered to be what the thing is. We ask the questino concerning technology when we ask what it is</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
 Heidegger provides two responses. The first, that technology is a human activity. The second, that it is a means to an end. At first glance, this may come across as something of an opaque opening gambit. For technology it seems, could be any activity at all. But the key thing is that technology is intimately related to the self: techology its a human activity. Dasein is front and centre to it. Technology is not something that is 'out there', but rather is at the disposal of the Self 
</div><br/>

<div>
 Heidegger goes to adds more specifity about the nature of this activity. He views it to be an instrument that can be accessed by the Self, a kind of contrivance the Self can access as part of the bag of tricks it uses to interact with the world: "the whole complex of these contrivances is technology. Technology itself is a contrivance". Philosophers have long posited the different tools that humans have available to interact with the world:  sensation, understanding, knowledge as things that are the disposal of the Self, so to it technology: an activity to be engaged in to create instruments (contrivances) from what is encountered in the world. The Self enocunters phenomena in the the world and has some ability to engage in shaping this phenomena to further understand the world. Hammers, paintings, change the objects of the world to curate them. Heidegger has not made a value judgement here. 

</div><br/>

<div>
It is refreshing stuff, the usual tropes are nowhere to be seen. No doom and gloom and harkening back around decline of modernity, and the spectre of technology displacing the human, anything to do with with pyschological impact of modernity or that technology is overbearing thing. Like I said earler Heidegger is not indiscriminate grumpy luddite. 


</div></br/>

<div>
From there, things take a somewhat Arestotlian turn. The means leading to an end is refashioned into a cause leading to an effect. As a guiding intuitiion, it might help best to equate the idea of means or effect as instrument or contrivance. Causes lead to things like the creation of wheels and hammers, a process whereby Dasien reframes of the world's phenomena and thereby enhances its capacity to engage in the world. A cause is posited as something that is an activity that leads to an artifact, (an instrument or contrivance) that has utility for the Self. It is a convenience, in the modern sense of the word. The course is four-fold, and Aristotle breaks it down like this: 

<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li><b>Causa Materialis</b>: referring to the material out of which an instrument is made</li>
<li><b>Causa Formalis</b>: referring to the shape of the instrument will be made</li>
<li><b>Causa Finalis</b>: referring to the purpose of the instrument after its entrance into the world</li>
<li><b>Causa Efficians</b>: referring to the the creator of the instrument, the artisan</li>
</ol>
</div></br>

<div>
But for Heidegger however, Aristotle's charactersisation does not hit the mark. It is all too arbitrary. Why only four causes? Why note more? Or less? Instead, things are much more interconnected. Heidegger claims that "the four causes are the ways, all belonging to each other, of being responsible for omething else". Thought that said, Heidegger arrives at three underlying causes.
</div><br/>

<div>

To do this, he provides a clarifying example: the silver chalic. The creation of a silver chalice is presented as an interplay between indebtedness, collabroation and interconnectivity of the self and the world. The first is the silver. It could have been a broach, part of a watch, but is a chalice. There is a notion of resource here. The second, is the "aspect of chaliceness", the idea of a chalice. This means to an an end, this cause or activity is then, a collaboration between the Self, the Self's intent in the world, and the material it has at hand. These things need to be hat accompanies the creation of an contrivance. Dasien is intimately integrated with the material. To be human then is collaborate with and integegrate what is found in this collaboration, to create "circumscribed bounds". It misses the emergent nature of the cause, interconnectivity and collaboration with phenomena, relating to an overall purpose, a <i>telos</i>.

</div><br/>

<div>
Now that I have arrived at Heidegger's post-Aristotlean conception of cause, and just about to land at an initial definition of the essence of technology is, I will unfortunately need to seguay. This is because, after loosely throwing around the term, I have not really defined what is meant here by Self. And to undertand what Heidegger is getting at when he talks of the <i>Self</i>, it is critical to use a different term: <i>Dasein</i>. Dasien is kind of like the Self, but it is something more. Both terms can be semantically similiar depending on the conversation. Dasien, though heavily implicit in this essay, is defined at length only elsewhere (most notably in Being and Time). Dasein is not just an everyday conciousness, it is not Descarte's abstract agent of dualism and mind and boty. It is instead an ongoing involvement between a human being and that human being's world. It is an onoing mediation and collaboration. More importantly, it is an acceptence of the human condition, where authenticity is defined as human being accecpting individuality, and limited lifespan, its mortality. Beyond just awareness of existence that one might use to define the Self, Dasein is about the awareness and acceptance of this existance.
</div><br/>

<div>
In the midst of this awareness and accpetance of transitory and impermant nature of existance, Heidegger is telling us that Dasein has things available to it. And one of these things relates to its ability to construct contrivances from what it finds in the world to enhance its interaction with the world. The essence of technology then is a mechanism that the Dasein utilises to form contrivances. It is a process of "revealing", an evoluion of Dasien's ability to interpret the world and allign its interactions here. Heidegger also has a word for descibe this: <i>Alethia</i> 
</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
Bringing forth comes to pass only insofar as somthing concelaed comes into unconcealment. This coming rests and moves freely within wha twe call revealing. The greates have the word Althea for revealing. The romans tranlate this to Veritas. We way "truth" and usually undersand it as correctness of representation</i>

</div><br/>

<h6>3. On becoming a beauracrat of arbitrary things</h6>


<div>
 We started with a what is technology. That providede a double answer around human activity and means to an end. An alternative way, to contrivance, instrument. We returned to cause, took issue with   cause -> beyond aristtoalian cause -> revealing for dasen. From there Althethia, or techne and episteme, and this links, so what is really happening is optemisation of knowing (JG - here the arbirary question above dissapears - not moral) - optimisation of self. And finally the definition of technology. Or the essence of technology

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Technology is a mode or revealing. Technology comes in the presence where revealing and unconcealing take place, where alethia, truth happens</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
At the this point there is a deifnitin of technology in place. But he needs to address if it is really satisfactory to apply this definiton to modern technology (circa 1958 at least). He opens this discussion with the follwoing: 

</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>It is said that modern technlogy is something incomporable different from all earlier technologies becuase it is based on modern physics as an exact science. Meanwhile, we have come to understand more clearly that the reverse holds true as well: moden phusis, as experimental, is dependen upnon technical apparatus and and upon progress in builind of apparatus</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
This is complicated, and could be read in different ways and comes at it. For me this creates a problem of information, Physics relegates the mass of information and storage the crical problem is modern technology is still revealing a mechanism that leads to intruments and contrivances. This is complex argument which but boils down to something quite straightrward: the self is not part of it removed from Aletheia. Heidegger puts it more poetically (which is problematic) It is revealing, alethia for no one. Heidegger presents it in a slightly difficult way, that takes on, paints him as a reminiscence of past, harkengin to simple times, presents it as "Moden technology (second last para) as a revealing which orders is not mere human doing". The way heidegger tets there, is to situatate standing reserve, uncconcealing. Its difficult to read this as confused, Modern Technology vs technoloyg ermerges. It is "anlocking, transforming, storing, and switching" which are ways of revealing. Regulating and securing vs revealing 

</div><br/>

<div>
In usual style, Heidegger brings his own language into tplay. Technology that is 'standing reserve'. And this comes down to a shift, to optiming the self, as reviealing contrivance, a profoundly creating endevaour, the self in service as of the non-self. Heidegger encapsulates this with another term also "enframing". So for Heidegger, enframing is revealing when there is no self involved in revealing. Enframing is the processing that leaves the trace of information, vast stores of information. It reduces the role of the self and a kind of innite librarian, rather than a writer of works. 

</div><br/>

<div>
The essence of Heidegger's argument is presient to essay reminds me of the K's meanderings in the castle: the idea that the processes the self enances on the world, the contrivances it seeks to make sense of have become removed from revealing, and just become. . eading this, and the title in this section is that Kafka novel. Like the castle, where K has been reduced to activity that is meaningless, revealing the world. There is a sense in which Beuract, arbitrary. Heideegger picks up on another thread, that modern technology, creates information that requires ordering and this becomes the means to an end. In sum, The enframed self is beuracrate of arbitrary things.
</div><br/>


<h6>4. On Storage</h6>

<div>
By about half way through the essay, Heidegger is riffing on the central dichotomy, a fight between revealing vs enframing, a kind of fight to retain Dasein or to lose itself. Before coming to the last big theme of the paper (which Heidegger denotes 'destininng') its is worth pause to to unpack. This essay leaves he a little unconfortable in the way it siutations Dasien coming from being and time, comes from a value judgement. There is a right way to live. An authentic way. To ignore this to be a sleepwalker through the world, Musilisan man without qualilties. And it this lack of authenticity is related directly to revealing being denigrated to a notion of enframing. But these are relative times, why is authenticity good, its seems overly subjective. 
</div><br/>

<div>
To explore this, I wanted to unpack another, more latent theme in this paper: that of storage. The mentions this serveral times throughout the paper and its worth consideringf them

</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
The revealing that rules in modern technology is a challenging
[Herausfordern], which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be
extracted and <b>stored</b> as such</i>

</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
 the windmill does not unlock
energy from the air currents in order to <b>store</b> it.</i>

</div><br/>




<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
The coal that has been hauled out in some mining district has not been produced in order that it may
simply be at hand somewhere or other. It is being <b>stored </b>; that is, it is on call, ready to deliver the sun's
warmth that is <b>stored</b> in i.</i>

</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
s nature, above all, as the chief <b>storehouse</b> of the
standing energy reserve. Accordingly, man's ordering attitude and behavior display themselves first in the
rise of modern physics as an exact science. Modern science's way of representing [303] pursues and
entraps nature as a calculable coherence of forces</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
This is interesting langage, rise of information, and rise of storage. Lets us resituations the debate, so it is not about positive revealing verses a negative enframing. THere is something much more pragmatic in play here. It is that not revealing  must happen a certain way and enframing. It is that enframing has no point to it. This resiutations the debate from one of a value judgemetn, to one of capacity. It is not that nothing wrong with enframing per say, but it has no point, and it it is antithetical to the self. Rather than cistuation informatin in the brain
</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
	In truth however, precisely nowhere does man encounther himself, i.e. his essence. Man stands so decisevily in attended on the challenging-forth of enframing that he does not grasp enframing as  claim, that few fails to see himsle as the one spoke to, and hence also fails in every way to ear in what respects he exists, interms of his essence, in the realm of an exhortation or address, so that he can never encounter only himself. 


</i>

</div><br/>

<h6>5. On Destining</h6>

<div>
Heideggers final postion, interested in possibility. It is not correct to say that this essay ends on an optimistic tone. It is more, that Heidegger seems genuninely interested in what might come next. He leaves us with with one final term: "destining". This seems to just be the myriad of possiblities of that might occur, the possible outcomes of a human that may allow the creation of revealing, and enframing is a mode of revealing. The threat, is not technology as such
</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
	
The coming to presence of technology threatens revealing, threatens it with the possibility that all
revealing will be consumed in ordering and that everything will present itself only in the unconcealesness
of standing-reserve. Human activity can never directly counter this danger. Human achievement alone
can never banish it. But human reflection can ponder the fact that all s




</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
In the end, Heidegger's technoloy paints a view of adolescence of. Will our destiny be revealing or enframing. Revealing will be a destiny, but enframing will be a framing for no one in partiular, a destiny for no one. But it is nescerry to evolve though this, into a state of being, it is nescerssy to inculcate this danger into a way of being
