<h4>Heidegger on Technology</h4>

<hr/>

<h5>1.</h5>

<div>

Martin Heidegger wrote his essay, <i>The Questions Concerning Technology</i> in 1958, after the full effects of the second world war had made their way at least in the popular imagination, turning point, victory for some countries and not others, but also a victory for technology. In some ways I suppose sense this is surprising. The sheer destruction bought on the world did not release a fear of technolgoy, rather, led race in technoloy fueled by fear. But I guess that interpretation would be to suspend human nature. Technological innovation, the perennial human need to open pandoras box, the promise a future, of control of nature. The pschology. In this backdrop Heidegger presents an essay is deep, introspective, and ultaimatily optimistic albeit in an unexpected way, cloaked in antiquated, but ultaimately bolding pushing toward  

</div><br/>

<div>
Reading the essayin the context of his biography, its tempting to paint Heidegger as some kind of luddite, living in the countryside and lamenting the affects on the industrialised world and its effect. His biography is complicated, his relationship to Nazism (and thier relationship to him which certainly soured over time) was but his status was, well its complicated. But I want to start with at the end he says the following, which to me, sounds optimistic

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>What is dangerous is not technology. Technology is not demonic; but its essense is mysterious. The essence of technooogy, as destining of revealing, is the danger.</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
Its an optimistic message, one might suppose, though predictabley couched in the Heideggers complex language that we should world

<h5>2.</h5>

<div>
One of the most the most enjoyable things about reading Hediedegger, is the sense that it is like pulling on a platonic golden thread, through carefully articulated langage and definitions and utmost respect for semantic clarification. He variously takes the reader through the biggest of quesions and there is the following arhitecture th. Pheraps, to be expected, Heidegger starts far out in the open and asks the most general. We need to start somewhere, so keeps it simple (in Heideggarian fashion) and starts be asking what technology is 
</div><br/>

<div>
<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Accorind to ancient doctrine, the essense of a thing is considered to be what the thing is. We ask the questino concerning technology when we ask what it is</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
That certainly feels like an opaque opening gambit, but he does not dwell in thispace for long. He comes up with two initial responses, the first that technology is a human activity, and the second that techndology is a means to an end. In this essay, brings out the complicated nature that human engagement with the world is a complex contiuum and needs. But the earlyu point here to make, which is for me at least, the critical part of the essay
