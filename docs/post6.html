<h4>Heidegger on Technology</h4>

<hr/>

<h6>1. Introduction</h6>

<div>

Martin Heidegger wrote his essay, <i>The Questions Concerning Technology</i> in 1958, after the full effects of the second world war had made their way at least in the popular imagination, turning point, victory for some countries and not others, but also a victory for technology. In some ways I suppose sense this is surprising. The sheer destruction bought on the world did not release a fear of technolgoy, rather, led race in technoloy fueled by fear. But I guess that interpretation would be to suspend human nature. Technological innovation, the perennial human need to open pandoras box, the promise a future, of control of nature. The pschology. In this backdrop Heidegger presents an essay is deep, introspective, and ultaimatily optimistic albeit in an unexpected way, cloaked in antiquated, but ultaimately bolding pushing toward. Waht amazes me about this essay, rather than position Dasien as a superior way of life, this says something about human capacity and storage, 

</div><br/>

<div>
Reading the essayin the context of his biography, its tempting to paint Heidegger as some kind of luddite, living in the countryside and lamenting the affects on the industrialised world and its effect. His biography is complicated, his relationship to Nazism (and thier relationship to him which certainly soured over time) was but his status was, well its complicated. But I want to start with at the end he says the following, which to me, sounds optimistic

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>What is dangerous is not technology. Technology is not demonic; but its essense is mysterious. The essence of technooogy, as destining of revealing, is the danger.</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
Its an optimistic message, one might suppose, though predictabley couched in the Heideggers complex language that we should world 
</div><br/>

<h6>2. From contrivance to causality</h6>

<div>
One of the most the most enjoyable things about reading Hediedegger it I get the sense that it is like pulling on a platonic golden thread, through carefully articulated langage and definitions and utmost respect for semantic clarification. He variously takes the reader through the biggest of quesions and there is the following arhitecture th. Pheraps, to be expected, Heidegger starts far out in the open and asks the most general. We need to start somewhere, so keeps it simple (in Heideggarian fashion) and starts be asking what technology is 
</div><br/>

<div>
<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Accorind to ancient doctrine, the essense of a thing is considered to be what the thing is. We ask the questino concerning technology when we ask what it is</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
It reads like an opaque opening gambit, but only for a monent, he does not dwell in thispace for long. He comes up with two initial responses, the first that technology is a human activity, and the second that techndology is a means to an end. In this essay, brings out the complicated nature that human engagement with the world is a complex contiuum and needs. But the earlyu point here to make, which is for me at least, the critical part of the essay: the self, the notorias Dasien from Being and Time is front and centre. Technology is not something out there. It is critically concerned with the self. And to forshadow the punchline, this essay is ultaimatly about the loss of self. But I don't want to get ahead of myself. 

</div><br/>

<div>
There is a friendly paragraph that follow this (pg 1, para4)  and in throwing a wide net on the kinds of things that are encountered when technology ("for to posit ends and procure and utilise means to them is a human activity"). He also uses the language of "contrivances" saying "the whole complex of these contrivances is technology. Technology itself is a contrivance"

</div><br/>

<div>
Heidegger is saying that leaving aside the pyschological impact of modernity and technology is overbearing thing (which is refreshing), for the Dasein, technology is one of the things that are the human's disposal. In the same way perhaps as assuming Kant, that Time and Space and things that are made avialable for the subsumption of the objeects of the world, Technology is another thing us humans being have. Technology is a thing (I want to say, its a technology) fashion contrivances to ease the way through the world. Hammers, paintings, change the objects of the world to curate them. Heidegger has not made a value judgement here. There is actually a nice Kantian link discussion for another day, the ability to not oassume phenoma but an addtional mechnanism to enact change. 


</div></br/>

<div>
The idea that technology is a means to and end leads to the idea of a cause, and from there, things to ake a Arestotlian turn, Heidegger probletasists idea of cause which seems straight forward encough 

<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>Causa Materialis: the material out of which a thing is made</li>
<li>Causa Formalis: the shape of the thing</li>
<li>Causa Finalis: the material out of which a thing is made</li>
<li>Causa Efficians: the maker, the means</li>
</ol>
</div></br>

<div>
But, for Aristotle, its all a  little too arbitrary. four arbitrary causes. Heidegger finds all this somehwat arbitrary, and repaints the causes, does it an links these and extends, why are there only 4, it is not instructive to map them. them, but my purpose is not rewrite the essay. thje main turning poins is that what merges with this, is collaborative endeaver. Dasien is intimately integrated with the material. Dasien is contaext of the shape. The maker. Collaboration. To be human is collaborate to be integrate, and technology is a mechnaism of collaboriation, to create "circumscribed bounds". Uses the language or responsibility, the agency interacting iwht the world. Here is this elevation of the self to a responsiblity, ethics, moral being that can do different things. There is a kind of intimacy which is being specified here. 

</div><br/>

<div>
From here, the thread gets pulled, but the larger context of Heidegger, Dasien, authenticty, this being in the world is in line with this and contribances But what ends up here is a double sense of technology is a mechanism tha affords contrivances, which must be approached in authentic. This is problematic, opinion, but the fascinating thing about htis essay in particular. The language shifts again here, and these mechanism, to capture these different words. The idea of "revealing"

</div><br/>

<h6>3. On becoming a beauracrat of arbitrary things</h6>

<div>
By this point, new language appears, this mechanism of interaction and contrivance gets a name: <i>alethia</i>, from the Greek, and "revealing". This translates to vertias and truth correctness. So there is a double sense here, that technoly, or at least the essense of technology is using this mechanism to engage in truth, to uncover something in the world for the self, reveal more of its mysterious nature
</div></br>


<div>
To recap on the semantic thread here. We started with a what is technology. That providede a double answer around human activity and means to an end. An alternative way, to contrivance, instrument. We returned to cause, took issue with   cause -> beyond aristtoalian cause -> revealing for dasen. From there Althethia, or techne and episteme, and this links, so what is really happening is optemisation of knowing (JG - here the arbirary question above dissapears - not moral) - optimisation of self. And finally the definition of technology. Or the essence of technology

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Technology is a mode or revealing. Technology comes in the presence where revealing and unconcealing take place, where alethia, truth happens</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
At the this point there is a deifnitin of technology in place. But he needs to address if it is really satisfactory to apply this definiton to modern technology (circa 1958 at least). He opens this discussion with the follwoing: 

</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>It is said that modern technlogy is something incomporable different from all earlier technologies becuase it is based on modern physics as an exact science. Meanwhile, we have come to understand more clearly that the reverse holds true as well: moden phusis, as experimental, is dependen upnon technical apparatus and and upon progress in builind of apparatus</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
This is complicated, and could be read in different ways and comes at it. For me this creates a problem of information, Physics relegates the mass of information and storage the crical problem is modern technology is still revealing a mechanism that leads to intruments and contrivances. This is complex argument which but boils down to something quite straightrward: the self is not part of it removed from Aletheia. Heidegger puts it more poetically (which is problematic) It is revealing, alethia for no one. Heidegger presents it in a slightly difficult way, that takes on, paints him as a reminiscence of past, harkengin to simple times, presents it as "Moden technology (second last para) as a revealing which orders is not mere human doing". The way heidegger tets there, is to situatate standing reserve, uncconcealing. Its difficult to read this as confused, Modern Technology vs technoloyg ermerges. It is "anlocking, transforming, storing, and switching" which are ways of revealing. Regulating and securing vs revealing 

</div><br/>

<div>
In usual style, Heidegger brings his own language into tplay. Technology that is 'standing reserve'. And this comes down to a shift, to optiming the self, as reviealing contrivance, a profoundly creating endevaour, the self in service as of the non-self. Heidegger encapsulates this with another term also "enframing". So for Heidegger, enframing is revealing when there is no self involved in revealing. Enframing is the processing that leaves the trace of information, vast stores of information. It reduces the role of the self and a kind of innite librarian, rather than a writer of works. 

</div><br/>

<div>
The essence of Heidegger's argument is presient to essay reminds me of the K's meanderings in the castle: the idea that the processes the self enances on the world, the contrivances it seeks to make sense of have become removed from revealing, and just become. . eading this, and the title in this section is that Kafka novel. Like the castle, where K has been reduced to activity that is meaningless, revealing the world. There is a sense in which Beuract, arbitrary. Heideegger picks up on another thread, that modern technology, creates information that requires ordering and this becomes the means to an end. In sum, The enframed self is beuracrate of arbitrary things.
</div><br/>


<h6>4. On Storage</h6>

<div>
By about half way through the essay, Heidegger is riffing on the central dichotomy, a fight between revealing vs enframing, a kind of fight to retain Dasein or to lose itself. Before coming to the last big theme of the paper (which Heidegger denotes 'destininng') its is worth pause to to unpack. This essay leaves he a little unconfortable in the way it siutations Dasien coming from being and time, comes from a value judgement. There is a right way to live. An authentic way. To ignore this to be a sleepwalker through the world, Musilisan man without qualilties. And it this lack of authenticity is related directly to revealing being denigrated to a notion of enframing. But these are relative times, why is authenticity good, its seems overly subjective. 
</div><br/>

<div>
To explore this, I wanted to unpack another, more latent theme in this paper: that of storage. The mentions this serveral times throughout the paper and its worth consideringf them

</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
The revealing that rules in modern technology is a challenging
[Herausfordern], which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be
extracted and <b>stored</b> as such</i>

</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
 the windmill does not unlock
energy from the air currents in order to <b>store</b> it.</i>

</div><br/>




<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
The coal that has been hauled out in some mining district has not been produced in order that it may
simply be at hand somewhere or other. It is being <b>stored </b>; that is, it is on call, ready to deliver the sun's
warmth that is <b>stored</b> in i.</i>

</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
s nature, above all, as the chief <b>storehouse</b> of the
standing energy reserve. Accordingly, man's ordering attitude and behavior display themselves first in the
rise of modern physics as an exact science. Modern science's way of representing [303] pursues and
entraps nature as a calculable coherence of forces</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
This is interesting langage, rise of information, and rise of storage. Lets us resituations the debate, so it is not about positive revealing verses a negative enframing. THere is something much more pragmatic in play here. It is that not revealing  must happen a certain way and enframing. It is that enframing has no point to it. This resiutations the debate from one of a value judgemetn, to one of capacity. It is not that nothing wrong with enframing per say, but it has no point, and it it is antithetical to the self. Rather than cistuation informatin in the brain
</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
	In truth however, precisely nowhere does man encounther himself, i.e. his essence. Man stands so decisevily in attended on the challenging-forth of enframing that he does not grasp enframing as  claim, that few fails to see himsle as the one spoke to, and hence also fails in every way to ear in what respects he exists, interms of his essence, in the realm of an exhortation or address, so that he can never encounter only himself. 


</i>

</div><br/>

<h6>4. On Destining</h6>

<div>
It is not correct to say that this essay ends on an optimistic tone. It is more, that Heidegger seems genuninely interested in what might come next. He leaves us with with one final term: "destining". This seems to just be the myriad of possiblities of that might occur, the possible outcomes of a human that may allow the creation of revealing, and enframing is a mode of revealing. The threat, is not technology as such
</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
	
The coming to presence of technology threatens revealing, threatens it with the possibility that all
revealing will be consumed in ordering and that everything will present itself only in the unconcealesness
of standing-reserve. Human activity can never directly counter this danger. Human achievement alone
can never banish it. But human reflection can ponder the fact that all s




</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
In the end, Heidegger's technoloy paints a view of adolescence of. Will our destiny be revealing or enframing. Revealing will be a destiny, but enframing will be a framing for no one in partiular, a destiny for no one. But it is nescerry to evolve though this, into a state of being, it is nescerssy to inculcate this danger into a way of being
