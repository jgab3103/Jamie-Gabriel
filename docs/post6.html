<h4>Heidegger and the Arbitrary Beauracrat</h4>

<hr/>

<h6>1. Introduction</h6>

<div>

Martin Heidegger wrote his essay, <i>The Question Concerning Technology</i> in 1954. Less than a decade after WWII, when the ramifications of widespread violence still to make thier the the nuanced layers the popular and scientific imagination. JG - bring in Skinner revisted through lect 16 Robinson... Far from the sheer destruction wrought being a signal to the populace at large around the the dangers of technology, the sustained bout of violence of the world war led to a rapid increase in the applications technology, from industry, automation and information, driven by practical problems of milatry machine. There is a complicated pyschology in play here no doubt: that inate human need to open pandoras box regardless of consequence relates to the rise of violence. Whatever technology might be, its manifestations alluring promise over the control of nature, a control over the time, and ultaimately immortality make it too seducing. 
</div><br/>

<div>

So it is against this backdrop that Heidegger writes his essay, seeking to capture something far deeper than just those surface instances of technology. The essence of technology is not something to be characterised by the presence of factories, or automobiles, or distorted industrial landscapes. Heidegger intends to dig deeper, to understand what it is that lies under the surface, what technology is when looking beyond its instances. He links it to his conception of Being (what Heidegger calls <i>Dasien</i>) that positions technology as a mechanism that Dasien can access, to facilitate a richer interaction with this world. It's hard to say where Heidegger's final position really is in this essay: not quiteoptimism, more a genuine interest in what might happen next as modern technology grows. Heidegger is not sure if technology will be the end of the human race, or come to be regarded as its turbulent adolescence.  

</div><br/>

<div>
A few disclaimers before getting into it. Firstly, Heidegger often comes across to me to fairly self contained when he writes. The invented words (thing 'destinging') belie an underlying and refreshing logic. There is in this tech . Secondly, there is (implictly at least) refeence to the Dasein. This does require some context from his other writings, but I will cover this and in any case, take a particular interpretation. Finally, it is tempting to paint Heidegger as some kind of luddite, a countryside recluse, and lamenting the decline of the modern world from a Wagerian past. This narrative certainly lends credence to interpretations of his biography is complicated, his relationship to Nazism (though I note thier relationship to him certainly seemed soured over time). While it's important to acknolwedge historical and moral context, waht fascinates me about this essay is that it cuts across the context of Heidegger's histroy and the time in which he lived. There is something timeless about it, that technology regardless of what it creates has an mysterious essence that is problematic for Dasien. I will use Self and Dasien interchangebly for the first part of the this essay.

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>What is dangerous is not technology. Technology is not demonic; but its essense is mysterious. The essence of technooogy, as destining of revealing, is the danger.</i>(p.2)
<br/>

</div><br/>



<h6>2. From contrivance to causality to revealing</h6>

<div>
Reading Heidegger is often akin to pulling on a sumptious Platonic golden thread. His language is so carefully constructed, words are invented when needed in a way that has the utmost respect for clarity. With an unwavering committment to first principles, he starts the discussion in the most general way possible. The question of what is technology becomes the general question of what, really is anything:
</div><br/>

<div>
<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Accoring to ancient doctrine, the essense of a thing is considered to be what the thing is. We ask the questino concerning technology when we ask what it is</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
 Heidegger provides two responses. The first, that technology is a human activity. The second, that it is a means to an end. At first glance, this may come across as something of an opaque opening gambit. For technology it seems, could be any activity at all. But the key thing is that technology is intimately related to the self: techology its a human activity. Dasein is front and centre to it. Technology is not something that is 'out there', but rather is at the disposal of the Self 
</div><br/>

<div>
 Heidegger goes to adds more specifity about the nature of this activity. He views it to be an instrument that can be accessed by the Self, a kind of contrivance the Self can access as part of the bag of tricks it uses to interact with the world: "the whole complex of these contrivances is technology. Technology itself is a contrivance". Philosophers have long posited the different tools that humans have available to interact with the world:  sensation, understanding, knowledge as things that are the disposal of the Self, so to it technology: an activity to be engaged in to create instruments (contrivances) from what is encountered in the world. The Self enocunters phenomena in the the world and has some ability to engage in shaping this phenomena to further understand the world. Hammers, paintings, change the objects of the world to curate them. Heidegger has not made a value judgement here. 

</div><br/>

<div>
It is refreshing stuff, the usual tropes are nowhere to be seen. No doom and gloom and harkening back around decline of modernity, and the spectre of technology displacing the human, anything to do with with pyschological impact of modernity or that technology is overbearing thing. Like I said earler Heidegger is not indiscriminate grumpy luddite. 


</div></br/>

<div>
From there, things take a somewhat Arestotlian turn. The means leading to an end is refashioned into a cause leading to an effect. As a guiding intuitiion, it might help best to equate the idea of means or effect as instrument or contrivance. Causes lead to things like the creation of wheels and hammers, a process whereby the Self reframes of the world's phenomena and thereby enhances its capacity to engage in the world. A cause is posited as something that is an activity that leads to an artifact, (an instrument or contrivance) that has utility for the Self. It is a convenience, in the modern sense of the word. The course is four-fold, and Aristotle breaks it down like this: 

<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li><b>Causa Materialis</b>: referring to the material out of which an instrument is made</li>
<li><b>Causa Formalis</b>: referring to the shape of the instrument will be made</li>
<li><b>Causa Finalis</b>: referring to the purpose of the instrument after its entrance into the world</li>
<li><b>Causa Efficians</b>: referring to the the creator of the instrument, the artisan</li>
</ol>
</div></br>

<div>
But for Heidegger however, Aristotle's charactersisation does not hit the mark. It is all too arbitrary. Why only four causes? Why note more? Or less? Instead, things are much more interconnected. Heidegger claims that "the four causes are the ways, all belonging to each other, of being responsible for omething else". Thought that said, Heidegger arrives at three underlying causes.
</div><br/>

<div>

To do this, he provides a clarifying example of the silver chalice. The creation of a silver chalice is presented as an interplay between indebtedness, collabroation and interconnectivity of the self and the world. The first is the silver. It could have been a broach, part of a watch, but is a chalice. There is a notion of resource here. The second, is the "aspect of chaliceness", the idea of a chalice. This means to an an end, this cause or activity is then, a collaboration between the Self, the Self's intent in the world, and the material it has at hand. These things need to be hat accompanies the creation of an contrivance. Dasien is intimately integrated with the material. To be human then is collaborate with and integegrate what is found in this collaboration, to create "circumscribed bounds". It misses the emergent nature of the cause, interconnectivity and collaboration with phenomena, relating to an overall purpose, a <i>telos</i>.

</div><br/>

<div>
Now that Aristotle has been dealt with its almost time initial definition of the essence of technology. But first, a segue. In the preceeding paragraphs I have not really defined what is meant here by Self. And an understanding of what Heidegger means when he speaks of the <i>Self</i> is critical. He uses an alternate term as well: <i>Dasein</i>. </div><br/>

<div> The idea behind Dasein is simliar to idea behind the Self. Kind of. Both terms could be seen as interchangeable, and they can certainly be semantically similiar depending on context. But Dasein is something far more. It is not just an everyday conciousness, or an awareness of existence, or a kind of Cartesian abstraction from human being, an agent of dualism navigating mind and body. It is instead a deeply immersive and fluid involvement between a human being and the world inhabited by that human. It is a collaboration par excellance, in which the human being accepts the limits of this collaboration as the nature of its condition. It is the self in the face of its physical and extistential limitations. Dasien is intimitely bound with the idea of authenticity, an authenticity forged by accepting responsiblity for this individuality, its limited lifespan and its mortality and seeking, withing these limitations. It is, in the face of time and mortality, a will to optimise the situation the human find itself in. And the purpose of this essay, paft of that will to optimisation, it is the will to create instruments and contrivances that can promote this optimisation and enhance its interaction with the world.
</div><br/>

<div>
So finally to a definition: the essence of technology then is a mechanism that the Dasein utilises to create instruments and form contrivances to enhance to optimise its interaction with the world. It is a process of "bringing forth" and "revealing" the phe(noumena) it encounters it finds in the world. This ongoing mediation leads to enhances Dasein's ability to interpret the world and to furether modify its interactions in the midst of these interpretations.  Heidegger uses the Greek term for revealing, <i>Aletheia</i> to capture this idea of "revealing" claiming: 
</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
Bringing forth comes to pass only insofar as somthing concealed comes into unconcealment. This coming rests and moves freely within what we call revealing. The greats have the word Aletheia for revealing. The Romans translate this to Veritas. We say "truth" and usually undersand it as correctness of representation</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
There are two other important terms Heidegger introduces at this point: Techne and the related word Episteme employed by Plato. Both refer to knowing in the widest sense. Activity of Dasein relates to the activities nd skills of the craftsman and also "the art, to poiesis; it is someting poetic". The revealing of the world then, creation of contrivances is creative process. Thus Heidegger repositions technology and preiment interaction, to mould phenomena it encounters to grow its understanding of the world. 
</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heed to this,
then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us. It is the realm of
revealing, i.e., of truth.

</div><br/>





<h6>3. On becoming a beauracrat of the arbitrary</h6>


<div>
So to recap: Heidegger's essay on Technology starts out in the most general fashion. It takes a kind of what-is-anything-really position. From there it moves toward an idea of the Self (now elevated to Dasein) that is in the word, armed with an ability to engage is causes that to lead effects. It is this activity that leads to creation of instruments or contrivances, that serve enhance Dasein's relationship with the world. This process is one of revealing, which Heidegger terms Aletheia. Aletheia is related to Poesis or Techne, leaving an image of artisan revealing the nature of the world.

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
Technology is a mode or revealing. Technology comes in the presence where revealing and unconcealing take place, where alethia, truth happens

</div><br/>


<div>
It is about this point that Heidegger needs to turn a thorny issue. Maybe all of the above does make sense, maybe this is an essence of technology, but how does this relate to modern technology? What about these creations that emanate from indusry, from the processes of mass production? How is an automobile coming off an assembly line, been the subject of an agressive marketing campaign is a marketing campaign, social media kicks in, where is revealing is this an act of Aletheia related to movement? To begin to address this, Heidegger notes:   

</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
...modern technology is something incomporably different from all earlier technologies because it is based on modern physics as an exact science. Meanwhile, we have come to understand more clearly that the reverse holds true as well: <i>modern physics, as experimental, is dependent upnon technical apparatus and upon progress in builing of apparatus</i> (italics mine)

</div><br/>


<div>
It is a complicated passage but, for me this is where Heidegger touches the very heart of the matter and lobs a critique at modern technology. What he is really srating to get at is that modern technology is not just another act of revealing. It is not Dasien in the process of Aletheia to create contrivances. It is instead a inevitable problematic side effect arising from all this revealing activity. It comes about due to the limitations of Dasein to effectively manage its growing multiplicity of contrivances, its growing collection of instruments that it has access to, and the growing collection that it leaves strewn across the world. All of these instruments and contrivances, eventually evolve. To put it , modern technology is not Alethiea, it is the outsourcing of its Aletheia when it no longer has the capacity.  is the outsourcing of Dasein's Aletheia. Its a too-much-information problem
</div><br/>

<div>
Consider the following example. Imagine there is one of these innumerable Self's, one of these enlightened Dasein's wandering the earth. At a point in time in its dealings with the world, this particular Dasein creates some kind of instrument, a contrivance, to shape the phenomena if encounters, to enhance its relationship with the world at large. A revealing has taken place. And suppose the object of this revealing is a wheel. This contrivance would no doubt have all kinds of utility. It woluld leading all kinds of other contrivances. But alas, this particular Dasien, being limited in its lifespan, only to wander the earth for an instant, then dissapears into the void. A next Dasein pops up. It encounters when wheels created by the first Dasein. More revealing takes place. Wheels are grouped leading to revolutions of transportation, furnishing demonstrations, physics arises, revealing is everywhere. But again, the Daseins involved all dissapear into the void. The Dasein's continue to come and go, fashioning the descendents of the wheel into all manner of contrivances.

</div><br/>

<div>
But at some point, something unusual has Taken place. As each Dasein arrives in the world, before it can get to the business of revealing, it is faced with the outputs of all the revealing that has come before. All of those wheels, all of these contrivances, pushing revealing to more specialised places. Dasein's freedom contrivances is overwhelmed by its need to organise things contrivances, catalogue information about wheels, the use of wheeels is so prolific. It is no longer in the business of revealing. But it is so worse that that, its instruments are leading to Modern Technology creating its own revealing, that will need to be cataloged,   </div><br/>



<div>
So I imagine there is no doubt from kind, something between the information, the kind of issue be that this tipping point of information, a rethink of Shannon's formula. Its derivation is not really the point, the point is that Dasein is no longer an agent of creation. It is an agent of beuracracy, and the infrasture around it that creates instruments to be catalogued. Dasien has become the quintessntial beauracrat, ordering a world where Modern technology becomes a vehicle to create things which must be ordered. Maybe Dasien has always been something of a librarian, having to organise what it finds in the world, but this library is being inundated with content, that is created arbirarity. Dasien can try and fight this, and it has. It creates to organise the information in the world. It obsesses, but its something of putting gum in a fire hydrant. Dasein is "anlocking, transforming, storing, and switching" leading to an existential disconnect, but there is no Aletheia happning. 

</div><br/>

<div>
Heidegger provides a term for this relegated of Dasein its new role as manager of bloat of information: 'standing reserve'. For Heidegger, this is a shift from Aletheia, from optimising ones place in teh world, to being in the service of storing and sorting information. Dasein has no time to engage in Aletheia, it derives satisfaction from  the self in service as of the non-self. Heidegger encapsulates this with another term also "enframing". So for Heidegger, enframing is revealing when there is no self involved in revealing. The satisfaction Dasein derives from revealing is satisfied by, organising, one no longer creates, one organises and sorts, one files, Dasein is subjectted and manipulation.  Enframing is the processing that leaves the trace of information, vast stores of information. It reduces the role of the self and a kind of innite librarian, rather than a writer of works.

We also need to be careful about the scope of this problem. THis is about Modern Technology, tendecy of relategation, but there is still revealing happening. There are in the world revealing still happnening, the improvising musician, the artist, the composer, Art has retained this revealing. But modern technology has transformed. I am troubled by this dichotomy. 
</div><br/>

<div>
This is a deep problem of modernity interprted in all manner of ways. Maybe I interpret it as The subjecgated self, the victim, the grand ennui, the self in politics, the self in boredomhe problem comes when understanding. Mayube a McLuhan approach is in order circular definition: modern technology is the affect on Dasien's revealing revealing without Dasein on Dasein, it fundamentally alters it. Maybe its a problem of storage and capacity, Heideggers talks of storage in this essay. Maybe the self is trying on some level to write it outself into oblivion, suicidal How does it effect it, its revealing is on the stuff revealing leaves behind, the derivative. Reveal structure that enhacnces in the world, reveal structure in the structure, modern technology is a removal from interactive. This si problematic, explosion of discipline. 

</div><br/>

<div>
This reminds me most of Kafkan nature of modern life. We wander the castle, we prepare for the trial, there are no revealing, there are forms to be filled in, information to be moved, and filed away. The enframed self is beuracrate of arbitrary things. To be honest, its a little unclear if this is depressing or not. Maybe the castle is full of other Daseins in the hallways obvlious
</div><br/>



<h6>4. On Destining</h6>

<div>
As Heidegger's essay unfolds, it evolves into a duel: revealing vs. enframing. Will Dasein face the world and engage in Aletheia, or will be doomed to toil in the junk yard that revealing has left behind. What will it be, beauractracy or art? Is Dasein's fate toto tend to life, or tend to rise of storage? The former allows an engagement with the essence of technology, poeisis, techne. The latter is to live in a tumultous world bound by the wastes of modern technology. The battle line has been drawn. 
</div><br/>

<div>
  These are 

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
  
The irresistibility of ordering and the restraint of the saving power draw past each other like the
paths of two stars [315] in the course of the heavens. But precisely this, their passing by, is the hidden side
of their nearness
</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
Heidegger's postion, seems one of pragmatism in play here. Heidegger does not seem to be making a value judgement, rather he is saying, there if Dasein matters, then ereh no point to enframing. Dasien is something that allows creativity, a view of the world, but it needs to be caref for, that it does not fall into its side effects.  
</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
	In truth however, precisely nowhere does man encounther himself, i.e. his essence. Man stands so decisevily in attended on the challenging-forth of enframing that he does not grasp enframing as  claim, that few fails to see himsle as the one spoke to, and hence also fails in every way to ear in what respects he exists, interms of his essence, in the realm of an exhortation or address, so that he can never encounter only himself. 


</i>

</div><br/>



<div>
So what is to be done? Heidegger's final postion, interestingly enough, does not seem one of despair. It is one of curiosity He seems genuinely interested in what might comes next. And to presage this, he leaves the reader with on final term: "Destining". Modern technology might be a threat to revealing, but might it lead to an evolution of revealing, a final showdown, a more waste averse revealing. Heidgger sets up the, its like climate action on an existential level  the possible outcomes of a human that may allow the creation of revealing, and enframing is a mode of revealing. The threat, is not technology as such
</div><br/>



<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
  
We shall call the sending that gathers [versummelnde Schicken], that first
starts man upon a [306] way of revealing, destining [Geschick]. It is from this destining that the essence of all
history [Geschichte] is determined. H
</i>
</div><br/>





<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>
	
The coming to presence of technology threatens revealing, threatens it with the possibility that all
revealing will be consumed in ordering and that everything will present itself only in the unconcealesness
of standing-reserve. Human activity can never directly counter this danger. Human achievement alone
can never banish it. But human reflection can ponder the fact that all

</div><br/>

<div>
Reading this essay, I was consttonly. McLuhan catch phrase, medium is the message. By this he measn that the world we create, its structures, will create the parameters of our ontology and the message is organise. Will humanity before secoming to heat death, succumb to somthing far more moribund, a kind of information death? not to be defeatist the end, Heidegger's technoloy paints a view of adolescence of. Will our destiny be revealing or enframing. Revealing will be a destiny, but enframing will be a framing for no one in partiular, a destiny for no one. But it is nescerry to evolve though this, into a state of being, it is nescerssy to inculcate this danger into a way of being. Whenver I
