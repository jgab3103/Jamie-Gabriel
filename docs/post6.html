<h4>Heidegger on Technology</h4>

<hr/>

<h6>1. Introduction</h6>

<div>

Martin Heidegger wrote his essay, <i>The Questions Concerning Technology</i> in 1958, after the full effects of the second world war had made their way at least in the popular imagination, turning point, victory for some countries and not others, but also a victory for technology. In some ways I suppose sense this is surprising. The sheer destruction bought on the world did not release a fear of technolgoy, rather, led race in technoloy fueled by fear. But I guess that interpretation would be to suspend human nature. Technological innovation, the perennial human need to open pandoras box, the promise a future, of control of nature. The pschology. In this backdrop Heidegger presents an essay is deep, introspective, and ultaimatily optimistic albeit in an unexpected way, cloaked in antiquated, but ultaimately bolding pushing toward. Waht amazes me about this essay, rather than position Dasien as a superior way of life, this says something about human capacity and storage, 

</div><br/>

<div>
Reading the essayin the context of his biography, its tempting to paint Heidegger as some kind of luddite, living in the countryside and lamenting the affects on the industrialised world and its effect. His biography is complicated, his relationship to Nazism (and thier relationship to him which certainly soured over time) was but his status was, well its complicated. But I want to start with at the end he says the following, which to me, sounds optimistic

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>What is dangerous is not technology. Technology is not demonic; but its essense is mysterious. The essence of technooogy, as destining of revealing, is the danger.</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
Its an optimistic message, one might suppose, though predictabley couched in the Heideggers complex language that we should world 
</div><br/>

<h6>2. From contrivance to causality</h6>

<div>
One of the most the most enjoyable things about reading Hediedegger it I get the sense that it is like pulling on a platonic golden thread, through carefully articulated langage and definitions and utmost respect for semantic clarification. He variously takes the reader through the biggest of quesions and there is the following arhitecture th. Pheraps, to be expected, Heidegger starts far out in the open and asks the most general. We need to start somewhere, so keeps it simple (in Heideggarian fashion) and starts be asking what technology is 
</div><br/>

<div>
<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Accorind to ancient doctrine, the essense of a thing is considered to be what the thing is. We ask the questino concerning technology when we ask what it is</i>

</div><br/>

<div>
It reads like an opaque opening gambit, but only for a monent, he does not dwell in thispace for long. He comes up with two initial responses, the first that technology is a human activity, and the second that techndology is a means to an end. In this essay, brings out the complicated nature that human engagement with the world is a complex contiuum and needs. But the earlyu point here to make, which is for me at least, the critical part of the essay: the self, the notorias Dasien from Being and Time is front and centre. Technology is not something out there. It is critically concerned with the self. And to forshadow the punchline, this essay is ultaimatly about the loss of self. But I don't want to get ahead of myself. 

</div><br/>

<div>
There is a friendly paragraph that follow this (pg 1, para4)  and in throwing a wide net on the kinds of things that are encountered when technology ("for to posit ends and procure and utilise means to them is a human activity"). He also uses the language of "contrivances" saying "the whole complex of these contrivances is technology. Technology itself is a contrivance"

</div><br/>

<div>
Heidegger is saying that leaving aside the pyschological impact of modernity and technology is overbearing thing (which is refreshing), for the Dasein, technology is one of the things that are the human's disposal. In the same way perhaps as assuming Kant, that Time and Space and things that are made avialable for the subsumption of the objeects of the world, Technology is another thing us humans being have. Technology is a thing (I want to say, its a technology) fashion contrivances to ease the way through the world. Hammers, paintings, change the objects of the world to curate them. Heidegger has not made a value judgement here. There is actually a nice Kantian link discussion for another day, the ability to not oassume phenoma but an addtional mechnanism to enact change. 


</div></br/>

<div>
The idea that technology is a means to and end leads to the idea of a cause, and from there, things to ake a Arestotlian turn, Heidegger probletasists idea of cause which seems straight forward encough 

<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>Causa Materialis: the material out of which a thing is made</li>
<li>Causa Formalis: the shape of the thing</li>
<li>Causa Finalis: the material out of which a thing is made</li>
<li>Causa Efficians: the maker, the means</li>
</ol>
</div></br>

<div>
But, for Aristotle, its all a  little too arbitrary. four arbitrary causes. Heidegger finds all this somehwat arbitrary, and repaints the causes, does it an links these and extends, why are there only 4, it is not instructive to map them. them, but my purpose is not rewrite the essay. thje main turning poins is that what merges with this, is collaborative endeaver. Dasien is intimately integrated with the material. Dasien is contaext of the shape. The maker. Collaboration. To be human is collaborate to be integrate, and technology is a mechnaism of collaboriation, to create "circumscribed bounds". Uses the language or responsibility, the agency interacting iwht the world. Here is this elevation of the self to a responsiblity, ethics, moral being that can do different things. There is a kind of intimacy which is being specified here. 

</div><br/>

<div>
From here, the thread gets pulled, but the larger context of Heidegger, Dasien, authenticty, this being in the world is in line with this and contribances But what ends up here is a double sense of technology is a mechanism tha affords contrivances, which must be approached in authentic. This is problematic, opinion, but the fascinating thing about htis essay in particular. The language shifts again here, and these mechanism, to capture these different words. The idea of "revealing"

</div><br/>

<h6>3. Revealing reduced to standing reserve</h6>

<div>
By this point, new language appears, this mechanism of interaction and contrivance gets a name: <i>alethia</i>, from the Greek, and "revealing". This translates to vertias and truth correctness. So there is a double sense here, that technoly, or at least the essense of technology is using this mechanism to engage in truth, to uncover something in the world for the self, reveal more of its mysterious nature
</div></br>


<div>
To recap on the semantic thread here. We started with a what is technology. That providede a double answer around human activity and means to an end. An alternative way, to contrivance, instrument. We returned to cause, took issue with   cause -> beyond aristtoalian cause -> revealing for dasen. From there Althethia, or techne and episteme, and this links, so what is really happening is optemisation of knowing (JG - here the arbirary question above dissapears - not moral) - optimisation of self. And finally the definition of technology. Or the essence of technology

</div><br/>

<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>Technology is a mode or revealing. Technology comes in the presence where revealing and unconcealing take place, where alethia, truth happens</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
At the this point there is a deifnitin of technology in place. But he needs to address if it is really satisfactory to apply this definiton to modern technology (circa 1958 at least). He opens this discussion with the follwoing: 

</div><br/>


<div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<i>It is said that modern technlogy is something incomporable different from all earlier technologies becuase it is based on modern physics as an exact science. Meanwhile, we have come to understand more clearly that the reverse holds true as well: moden phusis, as experimental, is dependen upnon technical apparatus and and upon progress in builind of apparatus</i>

</div><br/>


<div>
This is complicated, and could be read in different ways. For me, the crical problem is modern technology is still revealing a mechanism that leads to intruments and contrivances. This is complex argument which but boils down to something quite straightrward: the self is not part of it removed from Aletheia. Heidegger puts it more poetically (which is problematic) It is revealing, alethia for no one. Heidegger presents it in a slightly difficult way, that takes on, paints him as a reminiscence of past, harkengin to simple times, presents it as "Moden technology (second last para) as a revealing which orders is not mere human doing". The way heidegger tets there, is to situatate standing reserve, uncconcealing. Its difficult to read this as confused,
