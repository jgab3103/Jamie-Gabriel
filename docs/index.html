  This page to hold links to the various research study notes I have being writing up, or provide links to various templates/resources that I use often, mostly in the are of math and computer science. The plan is to slowly work through my messy Github repos, clean things up and post them here to have an easy point of reference.

  I have posted html versions of these notes, but included in each notebooks are links the relevant Github repositories. No doubt there are errors to be found here. So feel free to let me know via Github for any corrections
