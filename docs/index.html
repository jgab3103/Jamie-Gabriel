        <b>Maple Project</b><br/><br/>
        <div><a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Maple-Project/wiki">Maple</a> is a web application I have created for managing metadata, research and reporting programs of work, data requests, and is well suited for organisations running large scale data science and analytics programs. Maple sets out to elegantly and intuitively solve problems that arise when tracking data assets, data elements, data users and roles, managing data requests and data related projects, and positiion this metadata for analytics. In my last couple of roles I have needed to create applications to manage this kind of thing and decided it was time to stop reinventing the wheel, so open sourcing the code.</div>

      <b>Python for Math</b>
      <div>
          I tend not to use Sage these days (in favour of <a href = "https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel">this kind of setup</a>) but here is a really nice way to install and config the Sage JupyterLab environment running on Docker. For full details of the Docker Image see <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/">https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/</a>.

        <b>Python for Machine Learning and Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)</b>
      <div>
          I use <a href = "https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel">this docker setup </a>to manage all things related to my research. It is based on this really nice image at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/3rdman/htm.core-jupyter">https://hub.docker.com/r/3rdman/htm.core-jupyter</a>. Note that sometimes I have had issues with Windows install, but for MacOS and Linux seems to be ok.

        Note that Sage is pretty fully featured and the docs seem a little tricky at times, so wherever possible for this notebook, I have used the Python SymPy library - seems a gentle way to get into programming mathematics in Python. As such, this notebook should also work wtih a standard Anaconda Python install. Many SymPy functions seem pretty straightforward and I will include comments if I need to do anything that seems unintuitive. I haven't used the library too much as yet so feel free to send me a pull request with any changes if there are better ways to do things
