        <b>Maple Metadata Project</b><br/><br/>
        <div>Maple is a web application for managing metadata, research and reporting programs of work, data requests, and is well suited for organisations involved with data science and analytics. Maple sets out to elegantly and intuitively solve problems that arise when tracking data assets, data elements, data users and roles, and managing data requests and data related projects. It aims to make life far simpler for anyone involved in at organisation's data science, reporting and analytics capability, or data management and governance. </div>

      <b>Setup</b><br/><br/>
      <div>            
          I have written these notes in a Sage JupyterLab environment running on Docker. For full details of the Docker Image see https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/. I upgraded a couple of things, really just to install Pandas as well in this environment and had to update NumPy, so running sage --pip install numpy -U and sage --python -m easy_install pandasinside the Docker container.
        </div>
        <div>
        Note that Sage is pretty fully featured and the docs seem a little tricky at times, so wherever possible for this notebook, I have used the Python SymPy library - seems a gentle way to get into programming mathematics in Python. As such, this notebook should also work wtih a standard Anaconda Python install. Many SymPy functions seem pretty straightforward and I will include comments if I need to do anything that seems unintuitive. I haven't used the library too much as yet so feel free to send me a pull request with any changes if there are better ways to do things
