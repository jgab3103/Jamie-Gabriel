        <b>Maple Metadata Project</b><br/><br/>
        <div><a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Maple-Project/wiki">Maple</a> is a web application for managing metadata, research and reporting programs of work, data requests, and is well suited for organisations running large scale data science and analytics programs. Maple sets out to elegantly and intuitively solve problems that arise when tracking data assets, data elements, data users and roles, managing data requests and data related projects, and positiion this metadata for analytics. In my last couple of roles I have had to create applications to manage this kind of thing and decided it was time to stop reinventing the wheel, so open sourcing the code.</div>

        <b>Stelupa Score Search Project</b><br/><br/>
        <div>This research project started at Macquarie University, then University of Technology. Stelupa is a digital humanities project designed for the application of machine learning techniques to <a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Music-Score-Metadata-Builder/tree/master/musicXML2MusicJSON/corpus">repositories of MusicXML data</a>. It has a wide range of uses across musicology, music historiography, and music analysis and theory and applying music data to machine learning and AI methods. It aims to be flexible and scalable to the varying needs of musicians, academics, data scientists to explore symbolic music data in different ways. This application also serves data through a JSON data API to allow ingestion into different analytics environments. It is offline at the moment, through a demo can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9xebSuW9ys">here</a>. Will post a new repo link soon, currently porting this from React to R Shiny.</div>

      <b>Python for Math</b>

          This is a really nice setup of the Sage JupyterLab environment running on Docker. For full details of the Docker Image see <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/">https://hub.docker.com/r/cemulate/sagemath-jupyterlab/</a>.

        <b>Python for Machine Learning and Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)</b>
      <div>
          Running the <a href="https://numenta.com/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/">HTM Machine Intelligence algorithms</a> always seems a bit messy to set up - this is a really handy Docker image with most of the install done: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/3rdman/htm.core-jupyter">https://hub.docker.com/r/3rdman/htm.core-jupyter</a>.  Installing related libraries (TensorFlow etc.) seems straightforward. Note that sometimes this sometimes causes issues with Windows install, but for MacOS and Linux seems to be ok.

<!--         <div>
        Note that Sage is pretty fully featured and the docs seem a little tricky at times, so wherever possible for this notebook, I have used the Python SymPy library - seems a gentle way to get into programming mathematics in Python. As such, this notebook should also work wtih a standard Anaconda Python install. Many SymPy functions seem pretty straightforward and I will include comments if I need to do anything that seems unintuitive. I haven't used the library too much as yet so feel free to send me a pull request with any changes if there are better ways to do things
