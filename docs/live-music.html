        <p>I perform both as a solo guitarist and in ensemble settings, with a practice rooted in jazz and modern orchestral music, while being open to wide-ranging influences. While I enjoy interpreting standards, my work also draws on more contemporary jazz composers/performers, and I have created solo concert programs that explore the compositions of figures such as Pat Metheny, John McLaughlin, Joe Zawinul and John Abercrombie. My improvisational approach also intersects with classical modernism, reimagining the works of composers like Messiaen and Scriabin through guitar, effects, and ambient textures. Whether playing more conventional improvisation, or sculpting soundscapes, I’m interested in music that opens sonic possibilities and invites deep listening.</p>
        <p>To have a look at more of my stuff, checkout my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jamie.gabriel.775451">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jgab2275/">Instagram</a></p>

        <p>Alongside my solo work, I work with local ensembles in Newcastle and Sydney, playing jazz in a range of formats. I also collaborate with <a href="https://saja-music.com/">SAJA</a>, a cross-cultural music project with vocalist and composer Sally Jamila. SAJA blends jazz improvisation with folk traditions drawn from Sally’s Cook Island-Tahitian, Croatian, and Indian heritage. Our performances range from acoustic storytelling to immersive soundscapes shaped by loop stations, electronics, and live improvisation. We’re currently working on a new album set for release in 2025, weaving together multilingual songs, ambient textures, and jazz-rooted exploration.</p>

        <p>For live synth coding and music technology, I primarily use open-source tools that support flexible, real-time sound design and interactive performance. I often work with Pure Data (Pd), a visual programming environment closely related to Max that allows dynamic audio and multimedia processing. I also use SuperCollider, a powerful text-based synthesis and algorithmic composition platform, and TidalCycles (built in Haskell), which excels in live coding complex rhythmic patterns and integrates well with SuperCollider. These tools enable a creative intersection of improvisation, synthesis, and technology in my music practice.</p>
