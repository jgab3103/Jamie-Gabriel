            <div id="overview" class="project-overview">
                <p><strong>Learning Karnatic Music: Rhythm, Mathematics, and Improvisation</strong></p>

                <p>Learning Karnatic Music is a multifaceted research project exploring how the intricacies of Carnatic rhythm can inform learning, improvisation, and creative practice across musical and cognitive contexts. The project investigates traditional Konnakol (the South Indian art of vocalized rhythm) alongside advanced mathematical structures — including combinatorial sequences, ADE graphs, and fractals — to understand how complex temporal patterns can be internalized, manipulated, and applied in improvisation.</p>

                <p>Among the research outputs is <strong>Tempoko</strong>, an iOS app that functions as an interactive metronome, practice tool, and compositional partner. Tempoko enables learners to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Build and vocalize custom solkattu sequences.</li>
                    <li>Explore adaptive rhythmic grids with additive, subtractive, and polyrhythmic patterns.</li>
                    <li>Experiment with mathematically-informed structures to enhance improvisational skill.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The project also develops pedagogical resources aligned with Rafael Reina’s Carnatic music text and curated video tutorials by Asarf Sikis, creating a holistic learning ecosystem that bridges traditional pedagogy, digital tools, and creative experimentation.</p>

                <p><strong>Learning Karnatic Music aims to:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Advance understanding of how the human brain internalizes complex rhythmic structures.</li>
                    <li>Provide new pathways for creative improvisation informed by mathematics and rhythm theory.</li>
                    <li>Support learners from diverse backgrounds to engage deeply with Carnatic rhythms and polyrhythmic creativity.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Learning Resources</strong></p>

                <p>As part of the <strong>Learning Karnatic Music</strong> project, a curated set of learning resources supports both foundational and advanced rhythmic practice. These resources provide multiple pathways for learners to engage with Carnatic rhythms, improvisation, and mathematical approaches to time.</p>

                <p>Key resources include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rafael Reina’s Carnatic Music Text:</strong> Core exercises in solkattu, tāla cycles, and improvisation frameworks, forming the basis of structured learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curated Video Tutorials:</strong> Selected recordings by Asarf Sikis demonstrating advanced Konnakol patterns, polyrhythms, and improvisational techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Worksheets and Exercises:</strong> Digital and printable materials that complement app-based practice, allowing learners to explore rhythms visually, vocally, and mathematically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Pattern Examples:</strong> Demonstrations of combinatorial sequences, fractals, and graph-theoretical rhythmic structures for experimentation in improvisation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p><strong>Related Mathematics</strong></p>

                <p>The <strong>Learning Karnatic Music</strong> project integrates advanced mathematical concepts to explore, generate, and understand complex rhythmic structures. By connecting traditional Carnatic rhythm with mathematical patterns, learners can engage with rhythms in new and creative ways.</p>

                <p>Key mathematical elements include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sequences and Series:</strong> Applying enumerative combinatorics to generate novel rhythmic subdivisions and explore temporal patterns systematically.</li>
                    <li><strong>OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences):</strong> Leveraging known sequences as frameworks for rhythmic variation and experimentation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Catalan Numbers:</strong> Modeling hierarchical and nested rhythmic structures, supporting recursive patterns and polyrhythmic development.</li>
                    <li><strong>ADE Graphs:</strong> Representing relationships between rhythmic units and exploring graph-theoretical approaches to rhythm organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fractals and Self-Similarity:</strong> Recursive motifs and scalable rhythmic patterns that can be applied in improvisation and compositional practice.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Philosophy of Mathematics -->
            <div id="math-philosophy" class="math-philosophy">
                <p><strong>Philosophy of Mathematics in Karnatic Rhythm</strong></p>

                <p>In the <strong>Learning Karnatic Music</strong> project, mathematics is approached not as mere computation but as a framework for understanding how the human mind internalizes complex patterns. Carnatic rhythms — through Konnakol and structured tāla cycles — demonstrate that hierarchical structures can be perceived, remembered, and manipulated intuitively.</p>

                <p>Mathematical frameworks such as <strong>Catalan numbers</strong>, <strong>ADE graphs</strong>, and combinatorial sequences formalize these rhythms, uncover latent structures, and allow exploration of possibilities that may be difficult to express in conventional musical notation. These structures bridge the esoteric nature of rhythm with analytical clarity, enabling improvisers to navigate higher-order patterns and nested hierarchies.</p>

                <p>This perspective draws on thinkers such as <strong>G. H. Hardy</strong>, <strong>Bertrand Russell</strong>, and <strong>Kurt Gödel</strong>, who explored mathematical discovery, intuition, and formal systems. Mathematics, like music, becomes meaningful because patterns can be <em>perceived, internalized, and creatively manipulated</em> by the mind.</p>

                <p>By framing rhythm through this lens, learners can access latent mathematical structures in Karnatic music, extending improvisational possibilities, exploring recursive and fractal patterns, and developing a deep, embodied understanding of rhythm that is both cognitive and creative.</p>
