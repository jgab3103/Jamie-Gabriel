<section>
    <h2>Physical Clapping and Finger Mapping</h2>

    <p>
        The clapping is performed in a very specific way and is an essential part of the exercise rather than an accompaniment.
        In the opening <strong>4&nbsp;4&nbsp;4&nbsp;4</strong> pattern, each “4” represents one full <em>TA KA DI MI</em> grouping.
        This results in <strong>16 articulated notes</strong> in total.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only the <strong>first syllable</strong> of each group (<em>TA</em>) is clapped. The remaining syllables are articulated
        through finger strikes on the opposite palm, as follows:
    </p>

    <div class="clap-method">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TA</strong> – Hands clap together</li>
            <li><strong>KA</strong> – Pinkie of one hand strikes the palm of the other hand</li>
            <li><strong>DI</strong> – Ring finger strikes the palm of the other hand</li>
            <li><strong>MI</strong> – Middle finger strikes the palm of the other hand</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
        After the initial <strong>4&nbsp;4&nbsp;4&nbsp;4</strong> cycle, the tempo remains exactly the same, but the physical
        motion changes. All subsequent groupings are performed using a repeating <strong>clap–wave</strong> motion.
    </p>

    <div class="clap-method">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clap</strong> – Hands strike together</li>
            <li><strong>Wave</strong> – The back (top) of one hand strikes the palm of the other hand</li>
            <li>Continue alternating <em>clap, wave, clap, wave</em> for the remainder of the exercises</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
        Maintaining the same tempo while changing the physical action is deliberate. It reinforces the internal pulse and
        makes any instability in time feel immediately obvious in the body.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Rhythmic Exploration</h2>
        <p>
            The goal is to internalize rhythm both vocally and physically, feeling the 4-beat cycle as the reference while layering groupings of 3s and 2s. The practice emphasizes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Junction Points</strong> – where groupings align or resolve against the 4-beat cycle</li>
            <li><strong>Accents</strong> – hearing and feeling emphasis naturally emerge</li>
            <li><strong>Gaps</strong> – intentionally leaving beats silent to increase awareness</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation</strong> – separating voice, claps, and internal pulse to test stability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Initially, all patterns start with the stabilizing four-group 4-beat cycle:
        </p>
        <pre>
4 4 4 4
        </pre>
        <p>
            This is <em>TA KA DI MI</em> articulated clearly, forming the anchor for all subsequent patterns.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Mixed Groupings</h2>
        <p>
            After establishing the 4-beat anchor, combinations of 3s and 2s are layered. These sequences create shifting accents and challenge internal pulse:
        </p>
        <pre>
4 4 4 4   3 3 2   3 3 2
4 4 4 4   3 2 3   3 2 3
4 4 4 4   2 3 3   2 3 3
4 4 4 4   2 2 3   3 3 3
4 4 4 4   3 2 2   3 3 3
4 4 4 4   3 3 2   2 3 3
4 4 4 4   3 3 3   2 2 3
4 4 4 4   3 3 3   3 2 2
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Creating Gaps and Complexity</h2>
        <p>
            The next step involves practicing with gaps — intentionally skipping beats while maintaining the underlying pulse:
        </p>
        <pre>
4 4 4 4   2 3 3   3 3 2
4 4 4 4   2 3 2   3 3 3
4 4 4 4   3 2 3   2 3 3
4 4 4 4   3 3 2   3 2 3
4 4 4 4   3 3 3   2 3 2
4 4 4 4   2 3 3   3 2 3
4 4 4 4   3 2 3   3 3 2
4 4 4 4   2 3 2   3 3 3
        </pre>
        <p>
            Alternating groupings like this make the rhythm feel spatial, rather than simply sequential, highlighting the body’s ability to carry pulse even when accents shift.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Isolation and Integration</h2>
        <p>
            Practice separation of components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping the 4-beat cycle internally</li>
            <li>Speaking the syllables correctly</li>
            <li>Executing claps and waves as mapped</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Any breakdown in one layer affects the others, revealing where internalization is weak and reinforcing the concept of full-body timekeeping.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
            Stability, clarity, and awareness are more important than speed. Once the 4-beat anchor is secure, even complex alternations of 2s and 3s feel calm and controlled. The exercises demonstrate rhythm as both spatial and physical — junction points, accents, and gaps form shapes in time, rather than sequences to memorize.
