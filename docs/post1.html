<h4>Doing battle Stuart Kauffman. Again</h4>
<br/>

<div>

Stuart Kauffman's book, <i>At Home in the Universe</i> made such a major impact on me. It was hard going. It is one of those sneaky science books, where it feels like it all makes sense, but you just start getting confunsed. Like reading Vladimir Vapnick telling you something intuitive, but really relies on a a deep first hand knowledge of Kolmogorov. As far as like experiences go, reading Kauffman is kind of like reading Marshall McLuhan, the media is the message guy. THis made such an impact. Like it hard, and it feels like he is riffing on the science. But to be super clear: its super exiting stuff. 
</div><br/>

<div>
So when I hit <i>Reinventing the Sacred</i>, a book written almost 20 years later, I was was exciting. Not just because Karuffman's always a ride, it It might have been partly serendipitous I suppose, because I was reading it as well as coming across some other major things. First, Michael Levin's work on collective intelligence, this is really interesting, recounts this experiment about his research in planarium.

</div><br/>


<div>
Let's take a Levin insprised sidebar me take you through Levin's research idea which he has been promoting, most of YouTube seems awash with - but so he should, its amazing stuff) such a powerful piece of resarch. He takes a planarium which is a small organim, and cuts in in half. Then he hits with electricity. All the while there is is really powerful metaphor taking place. And the behavious are learned. I was driven to read Levin after reading Jeff Hawkins much awaited book on 1000 brains theory, which is just so fascinating, but I have been having doubts. They are having a breakthrough. Is there some kind of emergence that both. The sequence of enents, is worrying about Hawrkins, where its all heading. I have also been having doubts, because there is encoding, how do sensations get encoded. Levin also, fenobots but that is a story for another time. 
</div><br/>
<div>
So I was in an interesting place. Does Machine Learning ultaimately fail (unreasonable useless of mathematics, a classic Kauffman byline) the point of this fairly verbose instroducition is to make a point: the intellectual climate of the reading list was in crisis when I hit the Kauffman Reinventing the sacred. Because there is is something else. THere is emergent. 

</div><br/>


<div>

The crux of the argument is bold but heads back to ultaimailtly, autocatalytic sets so let's start there. Which are boolean network, in which everything becomes self sustainging. I admire Kauffman for taking on Darwin, as so often in science, making too much of. Its not evolution, about something else. In the end I was two minds

</div><br/>

<div>

At the heart of this is the sentiment that reductionism is importnat, but really, its is just not enough to explain what is going on. This type of argument is turning up alot these days, sometimes vitriolic, sometimes polemic, but increasingly well articultate. Sabine. Post string theory, its a classic what is to be done moment. 

</div><br/>


<div>
So lets' talk synopsis
There are some key ideas that are important: autocatalytic sets, and boolean networks
