    <h3>The Art of Effective Practice (Part 2)</h3>

        Ok, we’re up to part two of this article: practice tips four and five. Let's do this.
    </p>

    <h4>Practice tip 4:</h4>
    <i>Music is not about thinking. It is about hearing. Make hearing the focus of your practice.</i>

    <p>
        When I first began to get serious in my study of music, I always approached it as if it had some kind of solution. I kept examining musical structures as if they were answers to a question I could not quite pin down.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thinking back, it was almost like doing math, but music and math are fundamentally different. While they attract similar personalities who like routine and systematic learning, music is ultimately about sound and taste rather than calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
        I spent months studying Bach’s keyboard works, analyzing inventions and fugues. Initially, I asked all the wrong questions: why did Bach use an Eb here? Why did the modulation happen this way? Eventually I realized that words couldn’t answer these questions. Bach’s choices were guided by sound, talent, and musical context. The key was internalizing how he heard music.
    </p>

    <p>
        I started playing one part of a fugue while singing another, immersing my ears in the music to feel tension and resolution. This changed my musical sensibilities and transformed the way I hear and play.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thinking and theorizing about music can be helpful, but listening must remain central. Your ears guide note choices more than rules or theory. For jazz, transcription is vital: slow down recordings, write out the notes, memorize them, and play along. Singing and playing along embeds listening into practice, deepening technique, time, melody, and harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
        At university, our harmony and counterpoint teacher emphasized that rules were secondary. Instead, we sang Bach Cantatas extensively, developing a deep internal sense of dissonance, resolution, and harmonic movement. Practice should feel like becoming music itself.
    </p>

    <h4>Practice tip 5:</h4>
    <i>Always reflect on your practice schedule and its usefulness.</i>

    <p>
        Choosing what to work on is difficult because it relates to what will make you a better musician. Natural talent can make some people play anything effortlessly, but most of us must study strategically. Practice should focus on things that help connect with music and energize you.
    </p>

    <p>
        When learning improvisation, focus on specific skills: hearing chord progressions, recognizing II-V-I movements, and exploring different interpretations of standards. Memorize versions, play them, and embed them in aural memory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not all practice methods translate universally. Singing twelve-tone rows improved my ear for them but not other areas. Certain repertoire helped my technique more than others. Experiment and adjust practice to suit your needs, focusing on methods that genuinely deepen musical understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ok, that is enough for this second post! I’ll leave the rest to the <a href="./effectivepractice3.html">final article</a>.
