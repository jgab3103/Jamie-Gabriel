    <h3>The Art of Effective Practice (Part 3)</h3>

    <p>
        Ok, final two tips for effective practice. Here we go!
    </p>

    <h4>Practice tip 6:</h4>
    <i>Let the result be what it will be. Be kind to yourself and accept your moving energy.</i>

    <p>
        One of my favourite books about music is <em>The Advancing Guitarist</em> by Mick Goodrick. It pushes you to be creative in your practice while demanding deep study and hard work. Goodrick reflects on playing music and its evolution in a musical journey, saying, “A concert in Dayton on April 12, 1975 only happens once!”
    </p>

    <p>
        He is pointing out that even though you internalise and understand your practice, the outcome only happens once and cannot be repeated. There is no point attaching too much importance to past performances.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes you play well or compose easily and attach yourself to that experience. Next time, things may feel harder, and your mind questions what has changed. Often, playing without worrying about results leads to the best performances.
    </p>

    <p>
        The solution is to approach practice and composition where you are at each day. Accept the variability — some days are easy, some hard — and remember how amazing the human mind is at creating patterns with sound. Focus on being in the process rather than the result.
    </p>

    <h4>Practice tip 7:</h4>
    <i>Music does not make sense without other people. They are your process. That is how music works.</i>

    <p>
        This tip is about maintaining longevity in your attachment to music. Music is an incredible way to move energy between people — a form of communication beyond words and semantics.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have studied music for around 40 years, and I realized that music matters only when shared. It is a connection between entities in constant change, where boundaries between self and other dissolve. In this sense, music is other people.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that brings me full circle to how music works. For me at least. Time for you to go do some practice!
