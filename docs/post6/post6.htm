<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>In <i><u>The Question
Concerning Technology</u></i> (1954), Martin Heidegger sets out to capture something
far deeper than just those surface manifestations of technology: the
automobiles, the methods of mass production, the ever-networked world. His
essay is about going beneath the surface, and positioning technology as a
possible mode of activity for human beings, that may either facilitate a richer
interaction, or render Dasein unrecognisable and unable to connect to its
world. Technology is something of a final frontier for Heidegger, who uses it
to paint a picture of an adolescent phase of Dasein attempting to attain its
maturity. The essay’s final position, perhaps not overly optimistic, belies a
genuine interest in whether technology will evolve the human being’s place in
the world, or it will all come to nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>At first glance,
reading Heidegger’s work can feel like a relentless onslaught of verbiage. But
upon spending a little more time, it is more akin to pulling on a sumptuous
Platonic golden thread, where everything is so carefully constructed in a way
that has the utmost respect for clarity. Though notorious for his proclivity in
semantics, constantly grappling with grammar and translation, and for the
wholesale invention of words as they are needed. But rather it belies his
commitment to clarity above all, and expressing language that is consistent and
self contained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Note however, the
reader will always need to watch out for non contextual curve balls in matters
of philosophy. For this essay, the challenge on that front relates to
Heidegger’s conception of self in the word, which he denotes <i>Dasein</i>.
Dasein comes across as assumed reading in this essay (and to undertake that
assumed reading, the voluminous work, <u>Being and Time</u> can be consulted).
I will provide some context as needed, but a passing familiarity of Dasein is
assumed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Dasein is not the
same as self. While philosophy enjoys the unspoken privilege of arbitrating the
perfect arc between extremes of clarity and ambiguity, attaching semantically
similarity to these terms is not ok. The Dasein that Heidegger speaks of is
something far more than the self. Dasein is not just everyday consciousness, or
an awareness of existence, or a kind of Cartesian abstraction positioning the
human as a dual agent variously (though not specifically) inhabiting mind and
body. Dasein is rather a deeply immersive and fluid involvement between a human
being and its world. It is a collaboration par-excellence, one in which the
human being has accepted the limits of its collaboration and the fleeting
nature of its existence. Dasein is an embodiment of the understanding of
inevitable physical decay borne by temporality. It is also intimately bound
with the idea of authenticity, an authenticity forged by the accepting of
responsibility for a limited lifespan and, in the face of this, and to choose
to optimise the situation one is found in. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>A final note before
getting into the weeds of his essay: it might be tempting to paint Heidegger as
some kind of luddite, a countryside recluse lamenting the decline of the modern
world, some kind of glorious and idealised Wagerian past. It is a seductive 
narrative that, while arguably fitting conveniently into some aspects of his
biography, is surely an oversimplification. Heidegger always faces the reader
with a complicated moral and historical context that is important to
acknowledge, however what is fascinating about this essay is how much it cuts
across this context and the broader history of the time in which he lived.
There is a kind of an eternal truth bubbling throughout, that views the
integration of technology as a core challenge for Dasein to address in its
search for authenticity. </span></p>

the technology essay is the classic first-principles philosophical opening: be

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Heidegger provides
two responses. First, that technology is a human activity. And second, it is a
means to an end. This all feels like something of an opaque opening gambit, for
the implication appears to be that technology could be any activity at all. But
the clue here is to note while technology might be almost anything, it is
nevertheless not something that is ‘out there’. Whatever its content may be, it
is an indelible part of Dasein. Further, it is a process (rather than a thing
or artefact). It is at the disposal of Dasein that is undertaken to shape the
perceptions of the world Dasein inhabits. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Heidegger follows it
up with ever more detail, drilling down more precisely into the nature of this
process. Technology allows Dasein to have things at its disposal, instruments
or contrivances it can employ to uncover the hidden nature of an obscure world.
There is even an unexpected lack of majesty in the way he describes all of
this: technology is presented almost as a bag of tricks (being instruments or
contrivances) that add to Dasein’s attempt to clarify the world: &quot;the
whole complex of these contrivances is technology. Technology itself is a
contrivance&quot; (p.3).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>It is refreshing
stuff. Words like ‘modern’ and ‘technology’ are always such triggers for the
usual doom and gloom. But no tropes like that here. That teen-dystopia spectre
of technology displacing the human is mercifully absent. Like I said, Heidegger
is not an indiscriminate grumpy luddite, despite the vibe that seems to
emanate.</span></p>

take an Arestotlian turn. Means leading to ends become causes leading to

of the world are recast from ends to effects. This conveniently opens the door
to use Aristotle’s fourfold definition of cause and effect, and it all gets
broken down as follows:</span></p>

12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>It is a short lived
love affair. For Heidegger, this characterisation of cause and effect does not
hit the mark. It is all a little too arbitrary. Why four causes? Why not more?
Or less? And why are things so very discrete? Heidegger immediately counters
with an alternate view, that things are just so much more interconnected,
&quot;all belonging to each other, of being responsible for something else''.
Cause and effect are related to the profound nature of collaboration that the
Dasein finds it engaging in as it encounters the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Heidegger goes on to
provide an illustrative example: the silver chalice. This particular
contrivance, he claims, cannot be described as somehow emanating from
Aristotle’s four discrete concepts. Instead, the chalice appears in the world
as an interplay, a profound collaboration driven by the Dasein’s inescapable
interconnectivity and indebtedness to its world that furnishes it with the
perception of materials. Aristotle’s four concepts are reimagined as being far
a more integrated affair, where Dasein plays the part of the director in a
process of becoming, limited by the materials at hand. To be human is to
collaborate deeply with the world, to create “circumscribed bounds”, from the
appearance of boundless materials for the individual Dasein. The instrument
that comes to be, is an emergent phenomena that shed’s light on a previously
unseen aspect of the word and provides a purpose (a “telos”) to what was
material found in the world.</span></p>

12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Enough digression.
Back to the main thread of the definition and, at last, a definition for the
essence of technology: the essence of technology is a mechanism for Dasein to
create instruments or contrivances that reveal the nature of its world,
providing it with an opportunity to optimise its being in the world, to fulfil
its nature as Dasein. It is a process of &quot;bringing forth&quot;,  or &quot;revealing&quot;.

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Heidegger wraps up
the definition by invoking uses the Greek term, <i>Aletheia</i> (which
translates to &quot;revealing&quot;) claiming:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

comes into unconcealment. This coming rests and moves freely within what we

coming. Two further terms are offered up, (which admittedly turn out to be
particularly critical later on): <i>Techne</i> and <i>Poiesis</i>. Techne,
related to yet another term, <i>Episteme</i>, comes by way of Plato, and refers
to a practice of knowing (somewhat similar to revealing, but from a different
angle). This idea, along with Poiesis, comes together to paint Dasein as a
craftsperson, an artisan fashioning contrivances out of what is found in the
world. The essence of technology, this revealing, turns out to be more about
art: &quot;the art, to poiesis; it is something poetic&quot;. </span></p>

veritable pastiche of terminology, it turns out that what is really happening
here is that technology is a facilitation of the disposition of the artisan.
Technology turns out to be a means to art, a nod to the potential creativity of
Dasein. Technology, it seems, is something far deeper that what was perhaps
expected:</span></p>

exegesis that Heidegger needs to turn to a far thornier issue. Maybe the above
definition is satisfactory and the definition of the essence of technology has
been established. But how can this possibly relate to modern technology? It is
one thing for some singular bright-eyed novice Dasein to go about the world
fashioning silver chalices to reveal the nature of its world. But it seems an
entirely different proposition to relate this to the modern industrial complex,
one dominated by the trappings of mass production and automation. What to make
of all those anonymous automobiles flying off the assembly line, thrust into a
multifarious existence to be delivered by multi-channel marketing campaigns and
a vast endless transport network, interacting  dozens of subsidiary industries?
How can the neighbourhood Aletheia be accommodated into this version of events?
In addressing this, Heidegger claims:</span></h3>

all earlier technologies because it is based on modern physics as an exact
science. Meanwhile, we have come to understand more clearly that the reverse
holds true as well: modern physics, as experimental, is dependent upon

that it is here that Heidegger really comes to the heart of the matter. Because
modern technology is not just another act of revealing, the result of some kind
of multifaceted Dasein teamwork. It is far more derivative and abstract, and in
becoming more derivative and abstract, Aletheia loses its meaning. Somewhere in
the midst of the process of Dasein revealing the nature of its world, the
abstract of its revealing into theories, or into heuristics, into automation
arising from the proliferation of technical apparatus, Dasein itself is
abstracted away. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>This suggests that
modern technology may be a revealing, but it is a revealing to an inevitable
and strange side effect of Dasein’s activity. It arises due to inherent
limitations of Dasein to effectively manage its growing multiplicity of
contrivances, and the tendency of its contrivances to lead to more abstract
structures that manufacture more information, leading to an ever-growing
catalogue of revealing. The process of revealing leaves information strewn
across Dasein’s world, an endless of bits that needs to be organised and
reroutes Dasein’s efforts</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Admittedly, this is a
non-standard interpretation. Essentially I am positing that Aletheia, on one
hand, acts as the potential to enhance Dasein’s world, but on the other hand,
to lead to an increasingly unmanageable amount of information which acts as
existential pollution.  Modern technology is not just another instance of
Aletheia, rather it is the trace of Dasein’s gradual outsourcing of Aletheia in
the face of the potential complexity that revealing can lead to, leading to a
kind of tipping point where revealing creates impossible demands on information
management. It is a classic there-is-just-too-much-information problem, that places
a ceiling and Dasein’s mechanism to create contrivances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Let me illustrate
using a toy example:  suppose in a world full of Daseins who are all bubbling
along in different phases of development, one of these innumerable Daseins, at
some point long ago, creates a contrivance. Aletheia has taken place! And
suppose the contrivance that has been created is what a modern day Dasein might
think of as a wheel. This is of course a great achievement, though somewhat
tempered by Dasein's annoyingly limited lifespan: it wanders the earth but for
an instant, manages to fashion a fabulously useful wheel, before disappearing
into the void. But now the wheel is in the world, an object for the other
Daseins to build on. As  to be expected, what this Dasein has created leads to
all kinds of other Aletheia moments, so much more fabulous utility. And as all
the subsequent Daseins appear and disappear, the world is transformed under the
cumulative weight of their revealing. Wheels lead to momentum leads to force
leads to abstraction leads to physics leads to more utility leads to more and
more utility. That initial revealing of that first Dasein is a drop in the
ocean of revolution of revealing, creating a world as the world is increasingly
terraformed via complex emanations and abstractions. And all the while the
Dasein’s appear and disappear into the void. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>So the question in
this scenario becomes, is there a tipping point to all this? For the Dasein
that appears in the time in which I am alive, right now, what is it to be made
of all the outputs of all the revealing that has come before, all the
abstractions. How can it digest them in order to undertake revealing. Is there
a revealing limit? Is there a point at which Dasein can no longer explore the
word, but can merely attempt to organise it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Being a more recent
aspiring Dasien myself, I wonder if this tipping point might have some kind of
formula, some Shannon-like concept, some mathematical law that spells out the
limit beyond which Dasein is no longer an agent of creation but one of bureaucracy?
But then again, it is a formula which does not even matter. The underlying
problem is that Dasein has been cast into librarian’s clothing, a being which,
Heidegger notes, “unlocking, transforming, storing, and switching” has
inevitably led to a hopeless existential disconnect. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>Heidegger puts it all
a little differently more poetically, but his underlying sentiment is that the
revealing of modern technology is one that leads to information bloat. He calls
this process one that leads to ‘standing reserve’. It is revealing in the
service of creating information in the world, It is a move that, rather than
seeking  to optimise one’s place in the world by revealing it, to be pushed
into the service of simply storing and sorting information. Dasein no longer
has the time to engage in Aletheia, it derives satisfaction from the self in
service as of the non-self. Heidegger encapsulates this with another term also
&quot;enframing&quot;. So for Heidegger, enframing is revealing when there is
no self involved in revealing. The satisfaction Dasein derives from revealing
is satisfied by, organising, one no longer creates, one organises and sorts,
one files, Dasein is subjected and manipulation. Enframing is the processing
that leaves the trace of information, vast stores of information. It reduces
the role of the self and a kind of innite librarian, rather than a writer of
works. We also need to be careful about the scope of this problem. THis is
about Modern Technology, tendecy of relategation, but there is still revealing happening.
There are in the world revealing still happnening, the improvising musician,
the artist, the composer, Art has retained this revealing. But modern
technology has transformed. I am troubled by this dichotomy.</span></p>

like an abiding problem of the world we found ourselves in. deep problem of
modernity interprted in all manner of ways. Maybe I interpret it as The
subjecgated self, the victim, the grand ennui, the self in politics, the self

without Dasein on Dasein, it fundamentally alters it. Maybe its a problem of
storage and capacity, Heidegger's talks of storage in this essay. Maybe the
self is trying on some level to write it outself into oblivion, suicidal How
does it effect it, its revealing is on the stuff revealing leaves behind, the
derivative. Reveal structure that enhances in the world, reveal structure in
the structure, modern technology is a removal from interactive. The examples,
like the flood of revealing, come thick and fast </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

McLuhan’s adage approach is in order circular definition: modern technology is
the affect on  me most of Kafkan nature of modern life. We wander the castle,
we prepare for the trial, there are no revealing, there are forms to be filled
in, information to be moved, and filed away. The enframed self is bureaucracy
of arbitrary things. To be honest, it is a little unclear if this is depressing
or not. Maybe the castle is full of other Daseins in the hallways oblivious to
their existential plight.</span></p>

12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>So at this point in
the essay, things are certainly looking bleak. A duel looks to be on the cards:
revealing verses enframing. Will Dasein face the world in all its existential
clutter and still manage to pump out some meaningful Aletheia? Or will it
instead be doomed to toil in the information junkyard, a downbeat librarian
facing an eternity of aggregation? Will Dasein's fate tend to an authentic
life, or will it tend to storage and information management?</span></p>

actually not that bad. This turns out not to be the final battle, it is rather
just the necessary existential denouement. To explain the optimistic turn,
Heidegger introduces another term into the mix: <i>destining</i>. </span></p>

12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>So what is this
destining business? Heidegger designates it as the starting point, an initial
position for Dasein in its world, embodied in time and poised to undertake its
contrivance creating interactions. Destining is Dasein on the precipice,
seeking to a space in the world that can allow Aletheia. Destining is an
interesting into the history of all </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>The raison d'etre of
the destining process is to reveal, but as it sits on the pecipise ready to
reveal the world, jump into revealing, and the space of revealing contracting,
it is fated to reveal the world, and live in its revelations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>If destining is some
kind of existential trait, and revealing is the activity that must arise from
this trait, what is the result of this activity? For Heidegger this is where
the fork in the road appears. Dasein is faced with a free choice - will it be
enframing the world, or revealing the world. Aggregating or exploring. Dasein
is free to the extent that it can choose such different types of revealing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;color:#212529'>And it in this choice
will mean that the world will be more understood, but if enframing is chosen,
self encounters the self as a kind of standing reserve. There is an implication
here that, as time moves on, as Dasein must content with more history, enframing
is the easy way out. The world does not get revealed, enframing is the true
opiate of the masses, and this pushes Dasein to its most dangerous state,
because the world, rather than getting revealed, becomes stagnant, endless
revolving platonic solid infinitely revealing the same thing. </span></p>
