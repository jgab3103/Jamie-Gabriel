                  <h3>Fifteen Years On - Examining the evolution of John McLaughlin’s compositional style</h3>

               

<br/><br/>Some background for the presentation I am giving at the upcoming AJIRN conference in June 2025 at the University of Auckland. 



 <br/><br/><h4>Abstract</h4><br/>
 Guitarist John McLaughlin has built a nearly 50-year career spanning diverse styles, from jazz and fusion to Indian classical music, distinguished by his mastery of complex time signatures and innovative playing techniques. Despite his extensive influence, there is limited scholarly analysis of his music, particularly his fusion of Indian harmonies with the stylistic influences of modern jazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane. This paper examines two iconic albums—Electric Guitarist (1978) and Adventures in Radioland (1993)—to explore McLaughlin’s compositional style and its evolution over a 15 period. Both albums showcase his innovative approach to instrumentation and composition while maintaining a consistent artistic thread. The study highlights the harmonic, rhythmic, and structural elements that connect these works, analysing their significance within McLaughlin’s wider output and their broader implications for jazz and fusion. Additionally, this paper provides new insights by making available charts for compositions that remain outside the standard repertoire, facilitating further study and performance. Through this analysis, the paper aims to illuminate McLaughlin’s contributions to modern music and his role in bridging diverse musical traditions.

 <br/><br/><h4>Charts</h4><br/>

To underttake this analysis I have a transcribed a number of compostions of both albums. Musescore format of charts is also available <a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/tree/main/docs/assets/musescore-files">here</a>

 <br/><br/><h4>Presentation Themes</h4><br/>

In this talk I will explore compositions off both albums to understand the overall compositional style of John McLaughlin, and the subtle differences in the different time frames of the albums. There are are four ideas that underpin the talk: 

<br/><br/>

<ol>
    <li> Using a multi-metric approach to time   </li>
    <li> The use of Voice Leading to create rapid modulation and create ambiguity in underlying tonality  </li>
    <li> The use of Ostinato and Repetition</li>

</ol>


<br/>

<b>Using a multi-metric approach to time </b><br/><br/>

<p>Different jazz musicians approach time in various ways. For example, Keith Jarrett and late-period John Coltrane often displace notes across the beat to create rhythmic tension. A clear example of this can be heard in Jarrett’s performance of Someday My Prince Will Come (Example 5 in the presentation, from bar 143 in <a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/Someday_My_Prince_Will_Come_Composed_by_Jerome_Kern_Keith_Jarrett_piano_solo_(Up_for_It%2C_2002).pdf">transcription</a>).</p>

<p>
Another approach involves layering contrasting time feels rather than simply shifting note placement. There are many different conceptions of time in jazz. For instance, John McLaughlin uses a multi-layered approach to rhythm, combining complex subdivisions and polyrhythms to create intricate textures.
</p>

<p>
From the <em>Electric Dreams</em> album, examples of this approach can be found in the tracks 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/1_GardianAngel.pdf">Gardian Angel</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/3_ElectricDreamsElectricSighs.pdf">Electric Dreams Electric Sighs</a>, 
and 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/8_TheUnknownDissident.pdf">Unknown Dissident</a>. 
<em>Gardian Angel</em> features constant shifts between groupings of eighth notes, moving through 6/8, 3/8, 5/8, and 9/8. 
<em>Electric Dreams Electric Sighs</em> employs a repeating cycle of one bar of 8/8 followed by two bars of 7/8. 
In <em>Unknown Dissident</em>, the asymmetrical melody is supported by the appearance of two bars of 7/8 within an otherwise 6/8 context. 
On the <em>Adventures in Radioland</em> album, the piece <em>Florianapolis</em> creates the impression of shifting pulse within 4/4 time, following a highly syncopated introduction that includes passages in 5/4 and 3/4.
</p>

<p>
This layered rhythmic approach recurs throughout John McLaughlin’s career. In my talk, I will also play an excerpt from the rarely heard <em>Apocalypse</em> album (recorded with the LSO in 1974), which features a repeating pattern of one bar of 3/4 followed by two bars of 4/4. As the piece progresses, this pattern is reversed to become two bars of 4/4 followed by one bar of 3/4.
</p>

<b>The use of Voice Leading to create rapid modulation and create ambiguity in underlying tonality </b><br/><br/>

<p>
Voice leading is also a powerful tool for quickly modulating through different harmonies and creating ambiguous textures where multiple tonalities can be perceived simultaneously. This is achieved through the use of voicings that contain extensions outside the primary underlying tonality. For example, consider the following progression from 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/3_ElectricDreamsElectricSighs.pdf">Electric Dreams Electric Sighs</a>:<br/><br/>

E9(sus4 add13) → D9(sus4 add13) → B7#5 → Bbm9(b5) → Ab/Bb
</p>

<p>
A similar approach is used in 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/5_LoveAndUnderstanding.pdf">Love and Understanding</a>, 
also from the <em>Electric Dreams</em> album. This piece features the following progression, which facilitates a rapid modulation from D minor to F# minor:
<br/><br/>
Dm → Am → Dm → Bm7♭5 → Em → A7/C# → Bm → G#m11 → C#m7 → D#m7 → Em7(sus4) → F#m7 → C#m7
</p>

<p>
From the <em>Adventures in Radioland</em> album, the track 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/1_TheWait.pdf">The Wait</a> 
features a nearly repeating chord structure, alternating between 
Am → B/C# → A/B → Bb7#5 and Am → B/C# → A/B → C#m11. 
This progression creates ambiguity around the role of the note A, blurring the lines between it functioning as the tonic of a major, minor, or dominant tonality.
</p>

<b>The use of Ostinato and Repetition</b><br/><br/>

<p>
The use of ostinato and repetition is another key feature that appears frequently across both albums. In 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/2_MilesDavis.pdf">Miles Davis</a> 
from the <em>Electric Dreams</em> album, the latter part of the track centers around a single ostinato over which various instruments solo. The piece is heavily rooted in two tonal centers—C# and G—which function as pedal points, allowing for tonal ambiguity as the harmony shifts between major, minor, and dominant colors. 

Also notable in this piece is the main melody, which features many small variations of a similar phrase. This approach to building melody through improvised variation is a hallmark of John McLaughlin’s style, and can also be heard in the track 
<a href="https://github.com/jgab3103/Jamie-Gabriel/blob/main/docs/assets/pdf-files/3_JozyForJoeZawinul.pdf">Jozy (For Joe Zawinul)</a>. 
This track highlights Joe Zawinul’s influence on McLaughlin. In this presentation, I will also discuss Zawinul’s use of the same technique in the track <em>Scarlett Woman</em> from the <em>Joe Zawinul 75</em> recording.
