    "It is profoundly human to experience phenoma of the world and map it to mental structures, and ponder about the world and gain advantage and utility. There are of course many ways to think about this biological mechanisms, neorological, and much is not known. There are many beliefs and this is also a process of abstraction. \n",

Meta analysis Music analysis, literay analysis, fields of sociology, epistomological basis is the same in places. Background, study of literay has fields of thought\n",

    "Music Analysis is a particular interesting as it It is certainly possible categorise things in music and most music analysis does just this. There is a six-four chord, a cadential pattern. Things that tend to happen. It is possible to identify things that are typical of a parituclar style. Using music analytical methods similiar, grouping things. Tendency to group themes in literary analysis. It is highly individualistic. It has limited practical value, similiar to just renaming things, example of schenkarian analysis is a good, little. Study of music. Searching through a large corpus of examples to find the appearance of first voicings. \n",

    "Music though has a pseudo mathematical nature. Ther is a tendency for catetories and coudning It consists predominantly in identifying patterns found in sybolic music analysis. To categorise. There are things that tend to happen. There is such an excess of literatre of the field All of this analysis is mostly concerened with appearance of fairly obvious patterns and do not answer the difficult. \n",

    "One might say then, that music anslysis, is metaphorocial relationship to mathematics. Reimann or helmholtz, hindemigh make it look like Music analysis often masquarades that there is something comp9icatec happening. It does not make sense to say that one can calculate in the music. That there are operations in play. But operations that have any meaning in music. Musical structures can not be seen to be the result of certain operation. IN mathematics for example, the appearance of some object can be attributed to the rules of transormation. \n",

    "This raises a challenging question: how should we understand and analyz the information that arises from  music. How to make sense of this. In figure 1 below, there is clearly some structure in play. For music analysis to mean something and than vaguaries, what does that structure. Ignoring the sonic nature of music, symbolic, numerical pattern certain repetitions, etc. there is a strucutre here, but it is not structure that lends itself to existing analytical methods music would appear to have structure. Listening to Bach, there is some patterns. In Jazz this is predominant as well. \n",
