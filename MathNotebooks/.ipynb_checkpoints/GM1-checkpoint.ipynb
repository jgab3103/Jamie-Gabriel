    "<i>It is the harmony of the different parts, their symmetry, and their happy adjustment; it is, in a word, all that introduces order, all that gives them unity, that enables us to obtain a clear comprehension of the whole as well as of the parts. Elegance may result from the feeling of surprise caused by the unlooked-for occurrence of objects not habitually associated. In this, again, it is fruitful, since it discloses thus relations that were until then unrecognized. Mathematics is the art of giving the same names to different things.</i> - 1908\n",

    "We need to be careful in how we might Poincare's words also capture some difficuly that underlies mathemaics. For what is mathematics anyway? This question has been approached, Arithmetic, Algebra,Geometry into a myriad of displines, group theroy, algebraic topology. I think it is niaive to say that math is universal language, all the same thing, that when we scratch the surface of higher math, we find problems, ZF fullness, Godel, all the issues. For me this comes down to difficulty in reconciling the maing things, to accepting that we can make infinit amoutn of calculations. But regardless of these philisophical underpinnings in mathematics, many of the the same problems tend to over and over again. This is a general problem in any discipline In solving  \n",
