    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This set of notebooks holds my notes for Differential Calculus. Many of the ideas in these notes, are used to answer the folling kinds or research questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is understanding of underlying geometries in the neocortex, characterised by highly non-random networks\n",
    "2. Can different geometries (Hyperbolic, Differential) shed light on how to structure data of machine intelligence use\n",
    "3. Does the neocortex need to be understood in the context of topological space\n",
    "4. Use geometrical structures to inform structures in HTM theory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "My notes in mathematics cover roughly the areas of Linear Algebra, Differential Geometry, Algebraic Topolology, and Hyperbolic Geometry and have a focus on issues that tend to come up in computational neuroscience and machine intelligence. As a prerequisite, if you are comfortable with high school math that is probably fine. Alternatively, a great text I used is <i>Precalculus -  Ph.D. Stitz, C and Zeager, J, Precalculus</i>. These notes will take a particular point of view when it comes to Calculus and Linear Algebra so if you had a lot or little exposure it should be fine. These notes will also go through a number of foundational issues in mathematics and not move too quickly so you should be fine. \n",

    "These notes use standard Python libraries (such as numpy, sympy, matplotlib etc.) They won't use the Python Sage libraries, which I like but I want a simpler Environment. These notes have been created using a Jupyter Lab environment in Docker, details of which are on my GitHub \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to work through these notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Math of course is something to needs to be done, not just read about. A long time ago I realised that to truly understand a topic, the best thing to do is right a textbook about it, and this text is just as much as for the author as the reader. I hope its of value to you, and I wuold encourage you as you work through things to really see these notes as <i>your</i> notes. Change the Python examples, format things your own way, etc. Find ways to make things more understandable, seek clarity wherever possible. Feel free to send me pull requests with any changes that add clarity to these notes, and I can make changes in this version. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way in these notes you will notice I tend to include <i>Add to these notes</i> prompts. These are as much for me as for anyone else, things I want to come back to This can guide you with ideas on how to make them your own. Also, I often find in textbooks and tutorials that questions are really difficult and I find for me I want to slowly iterate through examples. So you will find the solutions are really geared towards that, gently exploring and extending ways that we can understand. \n",

    "The these Differential Geometry Notebooks, I will start off by exploring some basic curves (things like conics, basic cubics etc.) and also explore some well known studied in antiquity Ancient Greek Mathematicians. I will go between this and the seventeenth of century to view geometry from a Cartesian and algebraic point of view, with its emphasis on mechanics and motion (from Euler, Newton, Cauchy and Gauss) We will explore parameterisation of curves, the differential calculus of curves, take the point of view of Lagrange when building up our Calculus, explore applications in finite fields, and different geometries (i.e. projective geometry), understand different tyypes of curvature and structure, and eventually move towards more complex constructs such as topological spaces and manifolds. \n",
