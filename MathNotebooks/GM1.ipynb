    "<i>It is the harmony of the different parts, their symmetry, and their happy adjustment; it is, in a word, all that introduces order, all that gives them unity, that enables us to obtain a clear comprehension of the whole as well as of the parts. Elegance may result from the feeling of surprise caused by the unlooked-for occurrence of objects not habitually associated. In this, again, it is fruitful, since it discloses thus relations that were until then unrecognized. Mathematics is the art of giving the same names to different things.</i> - 1908\n",

    "Poincare's words also capture some difficuly that underlies mathemaics. For what is mathematics anyway? Arithmetic, Algebra,Geometry. One of the central problems in mathematics, is that one runs into the same problems over and over again. This is a general problem in any discipline In solving  critical problem in mathematics is related to <b>symmetry</b> and <b>invariance </b>\n",

    "But we could also consider and I would like to is interesting to consider this from the standpoint computer scientist what this means, to take it literally. The fundamental problem of mathematics is that of naming things. If we take anything we percieve as \"things\" in the world, this book, that cup, subjective application, and we name them. It tells us that this arbitrary naming of things is consiousness. But just as easily look at glass. Or a wine glass or a scotch glass, they are still glasses. \n",
